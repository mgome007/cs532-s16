   [10][protecting%2Byour%2Bdigital%2Bstore-800x515.jpg]

[11]PM Legal Minute published an article highlighting the best practices for
protecting our digital stores.  “Protecting it is paramount to protecting
your brand.”

   Accordingly, our business’s trademark symbol (™)   and logo are
   valuable “intellectual property assets” that are protected by trademark
   law.  This trademark identifies your services.  Therefore, in order to
   protect your trademark under federal law, you must file an application
   with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ([12]USPTO).
   Once you complete the task of registering your trademark with the
   USPTO, you can sue others for trademark infringement.  You will also be
   able to use the ® symbol to protect your mark.  However, if you do not
   get your federal registration, you can still establish common law
   rights by using the ™ symbol after the ® mark.
   PM Legal also notes, “That there is a difference between trademark law
   protection for your company name and the act of filing documents in a
   state to form your company or registering with the intent to do
   business as a foreign corporation in another state.  Filing documents
   with the states to reserve your corporate name and form the business
   does not give you any trademark protection, rights or ownership in your
   company’s name.”

Are you using Government Logo’s properly?

   If you are using a government logo, keep in mind that you cannot use a
   federal government logo without their permission.  Check your contract
   to see if it describes the best practices for displaying their crest or
   logo on your website.  The agency may provide permission in the
   contract.  In addition, depending on the agency, some agencies allow it
   by virtue of a blanket rule in their regulations.
   If you are unable to find any reference to using their logo or crest on
   your website, then email the agency and ask for permission to use their
   logo on your site.

Do you use a copyright notice on your website?

   Works of authorship: original content, photographs, or artistic works
   are another type of intellectual property that you can protect with
   copyright laws.  “Certain” elements fall within the copyright
   protection such as:

     * Blog post
     * Marketing videos
     * Creating graphic elements

   The best practice to protect written work, use a copyright notice on
   the bottom of your website.  Your copyright notice should consist of
   using three elements:

    1. The © symbol, or the work “Copyright” or the abbreviation “copr.”
    2. The year of the first publication
    3. The name of the owner of copyright in the work

Have you registered your domain name?

   The first step in securing your brand name, this process is a part of
   your website address.  Best practice is registering your domain name
   with an accredited domain name registrar.
   However, this is not the same as trademark registration with the
   USPTO.  “Domain name registration does not grant trademark law
   protection, rights or ownership.” ~ PM Legal

Protecting Tour Trade Secrets

   As PM Legal explains, “your trade secrets consist of your ‘secret
   sauce’ such as financial, business, scientific, or technical
   information and know-how that are unique and developed by your company
   for its own proprietary use.”
   You should take steps to protect your trade secrets.  Such as,
   monitoring your website regularly to make sure your secrets are
   intact.  Trade secrets can last forever.  Protecting them does not
   require filing with the USPTO.  However, federally protected
   intellectual property, patents and trademarks, have a defined term.
   PM Legal also advises us not to disclose any information related to
   your trade secrets through marketing efforts.  This may be tempting for
   gaining an advantage over competitors when promoting your products or
   services.
   However, do not let your marketing efforts get in the way of protecting
   your intellectual property because you may inadvertently share some
   valuable information that can be damaging to the growth of your
   business.

   [13][Google-New-Mobile-Ranking-Signal-800x450.jpg]
   Google will be releasing a new “mobile-friendliness” ranking signal on
   April 21 and Google states this will have a “significant impact” on the
   search results. The change will affect mobile searches in all languages
   worldwide. Google states on their Webmaster Central Blog that users
   will find it easier to get relevant, high quality search results that
   are optimized for their devices.
   It is well known that Google has been insisting that site owners adapt
   to a responsive design. The way Google sees it:

     When it comes to search on mobile devices, users should get the most
     relevant and timely results, no matter if the information lives on
     mobile-friendly web pages or apps. As more people use mobile devices
     to access the internet, our algorithms have to adapt to these usage
     patterns. In the past, we’ve made updates to ensure a site is
     configured properly and viewed on modern devices. We’ve made it
     easier for users to find mobile-friendly web pages and we’ve
     introduced App Indexing to surface useful content from apps."

Mobile-Friendly Ranking Factor

   On October 14, 2015, Google started displaying a gray mobile-friendly
   label on the mobile search results list indicating that a site is
   meeting their standards. For websites that aren’t mobile-friendly they
   are displaying a strike-through on the mobile icon to discourage
   visitors. Google is always seeking new ways to enhance their user’s
   experience as they browse for things on the Internet.
   [INS: :INS]
   To help website owners adapt to the new changes, Google provides a
   [14]guide for mobile-friendly sites. Webmasters can get ready for this
   change by using the following tools to see how Googlebot views your
   page:
     * If you want to test a few pages, you can use the
       [15]Mobile-Friendly Test.
     * If you already have a website, you can use your Webmaster Tools
       account to get a full list of mobile usability issues across your
       site using the Mobile Usability Report.

   For those who have been taking advantage of their App Index, Google
   will now surface content from indexed apps more prominently in search.
   Google has already begun to use information from indexing apps as a
   factor in ranking for signed-in users who have the app installed. If
   you don’t know how to use App Indexing, Google provides a
   [16]step-by-step guide on their developer site.
   Google has laid out some “criteria” for meeting their standards.
   Webmasters should avoid software that isn’t common on mobile devices.
   Such as Flash, Google started showing messages in mobile search
   indicating that a site “Uses Flash. May not work on your device.”
   Google also states that websites should use text that is readable
   without zooming, and should size content to the screen so that users
   don’t have to scroll horizontally or zoom. In addition, links should be
   placed far enough apart so that the correct one can be tapped easily.
   Other corrections that may be necessary for your site to rank well with
   Google can be further gained from using their [17]PageSpeed Insights
   tool.
