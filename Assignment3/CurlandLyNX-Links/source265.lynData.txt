     * avid reader of as many programming and CS books as he can find

     * husband and [17]dad

   I’m based in Louth, Lincolnshire in the United Kingdom. I mostly work
   online so I get to live where I love.

News

     * I’m currently [18]evangelist for [19]Rails Rumble, a popular annual
       Web development contest. Registration starts October 1st if you’re
       interested!
     * I’m beginning to offer consulting services to companies who want to
       launch e-mail newsletters or otherwise make their e-mail
       newsletters work well for them. If you’re interested, get in touch.
     * I’m working on a book - [20]Self Promotion For Geeks - due soon
       (been saying that a while ;-)). If you want to be notified and get
       a discount, fill in the form there.
     * I’ll be lecturing as a part of [21]App Academy
     * I’m speaking at [22]All Your Base Conf in Oxford this November.
       It’s a conference about NoSQL databases.

Web Projects

     * [23]Ruby Weekly - A weekly Ruby programming e-mail newsletter
       started in August 2010 and at about 16000 subscribers so far.
     * [24]Ruby Inside - A blog about the Ruby programming language and
       associated technologies. Approximately 26,000 subscribers.
     * [25]JavaScript Weekly - A weekly JavaScript programming e-mail
       newsletter started in January 2011 and at about 32,000 subscribers
       so far.
     * [26]JavaScript Daily - A JavaScript Twitter feed with daily
       JavaScript news, a sister Twitter account for JavaScript Weekly
       really. Over 6000 subscribers so far which, I believe, makes it the
       most popular JavaScript news account on Twitter(?)
     * [27]Code Wisdom - A Twitter feed dedicated to programming related
       quotes and wisdom. Now at 14,000 subscribers.
     * [28]HTML5 Weekly - the latest in my line of curated e-mail
       newsletters, now close to 20,000 subscribers.
     * [29]StatusCode - a weekly e-mail digest for programmers. Now at
       7,000 subscribers.
     * [30]Dart Weekly - Another weekly newsletter, this time about
       Google’s new Dart language. Currently just over 1,000 subscribers
       but not going out every week due to lack of content in the Dart
       world.
     * [31]Fitness Inventor - I’m responsible for the technology and
       design of Fitness Inventor, a health and fitness Q&A site (think
       Quora or Stack Overflow but for health and nutrition). The team is
       led by Dr. Dan Reardon.
     * [32]RubyFlow - A community driven link blog for the Ruby and Rails
       communities (~8000 subscribers and 2000 registered users).
     * [33]Hacker Slide - Time based snapshots of Hacker News you can
       scroll through. Ideal for catching up due to the speed of HN’s
       front page now. The [34]code is on GitHub and BSD licensed.
     * [35]Rails Inside - A blog about the Rails Web application
       development framework (~6700 subscribers). Dormant.
     * [36]TweetCanal - A real time, automatically updating Twitter
       “dashboard”/river. Perfect for watching what’s going on in the
       world without any delays or queuing. I personally enjoy it for
       watching the heckling during The Apprentice and other TV shows.
       Developed along with Nelson K of [37]Safarista Design at [38]Leeds
       Hack on November 6-7, 2010, where it won “Best Dashboard.”
     * [39]coder.io - A site I built focusing on aggregating news and
       links for software developers. I never truly launched it and while
       it’s still running OK, it’s currently on the backburner.
     * [40]Ruby Jobs Board - A popular, paid Ruby and Rails jobs board.
       Post your Ruby and Rails job listings there.
     * [41]Criminal Record Disclosure Calculator - A pro-bono project
       developed with an offender rehabilitation charity. It allows people
       to work out how long they need to disclose their convictions for
       (this is complex to work out under UK law).

Podcasting

     * Since 2010, I have been the co-host of [51]The Ruby Show with Jason

     * I’m the co-host of [53]The JavaScript Show along with Jason Seifer.
       We’re now a year in and getting anywhere between 5000-9000

       developers who want to recover the Ruby basics in a more formal way
       and gain some confidence about becoming a professional Rubyist.
     * Over 2011 and 2012, I gave 6 4-week online Ruby courses at
       [63]CodeLesson to 104 paying students on dates starting: January

       November 2011 and 31 January 2012.

Code

     * [64]Trtl - A turtle graphics system for Ruby.
     * [65]Massive Attract - An HTML5 and JavaScript game I rapidly
       developed for the Ludum Dare 23 gamedev contest.
     * [66]TestRocket - A tiny testing library for Ruby. It won a
       [67]publicly judged CodeBrawl contest so I thought I’d release it
       properly.
     * [68]Bodge - A game I developed in 48 hours for Ludum Dare 22, a
       game development contest. It’s open source and uses LWJGL from
       JRuby.
     * [69]Prelude of the Chambered - JRuby port - A JRuby port of a Java
       game written by Notch (of Minecraft fame). Still not entirely
       complete, but functional. 2 solid days of fun porting Java ;-)
     * [70]WhatLanguage - a Ruby library to detect the language of texts
     * [71]Pismo - a content analysis and metadata extraction library
     * [72]rubyflow build from 2008 - An old build of the RubyFlow.com
       Rails 2.x source code that I shared in 2008 and that has been
       maintained by 3rd parties. Heroku [73]posted about how to install
       it.
     * [74]bitarray - Simple, pure Ruby bit array/bitfield implementation.
     * [75]code2png - Render source code to a PNG image on OS X. Using
       this for my Kindle experiments.
     * [76]16 step drum machine with CoffeeScript and Node - A bit of fun.
     * [77]My GitHub profile - I have a few other minor things going on.
     * [78]My GitHub gists - My most interesting bits of code are the
       short bits I share as ‘gists’ on GitHub :-) See a DNS server
       written in Ruby, a couple of mini test libraries, an IRB prompt for
       multiple installs of Ruby (at once), and my Twitter UI restyling
       (since the new Twitter UI is.. not good).

Past Projects

     * [79]Code Snippets - A tagged code snippets site I built in 2005 and
       sold to [80]DZone in 2007.
     * [81]Feed Digest (now Feed Informer) - Web feed manipulation and
       syndication service I launched in 2005 and sold to Vicman

       Agriculture. Traffic was 250m requests per month. Update: I’ve
       [82]written about the sale.
     * [83]Mobile Orchard - iPhone developer news blog and podcast
       co-founded with Dan Grigsby in 2008. I designed the site and
       produced most of the content for the first 3 months. I handed it

       about the BBC’s “The Apprentice” show in real time.

       Passenger within two months but the [85]code remains on GitHub for
       historical purposes.
     * Editor of WebPedia.com which was acquired by Internet.com in 1999.
       I was then joint editor of Internet.com’s WebDeveloper.com until
