   Carol Chiodo is a writer, scholar, and educator whose work
   investigates how the material and structural changes in the
   reproduction, storage and transmission of texts impact the ways we
   read, write and learn. She holds a Ph.D. degree in Italian Language and
   Literature and is currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the
   Institute of Sacred Music and the [29]Digital Humanities Lab at Yale
   University.

   Her research explores the interactions between literature and
   technology from medieval manuscript culture to the present day.  She is
   particularly interested in the relationship between material culture
   and stylistic innovation. The problem of knowledge management and
   the history of book, the histories of libraries, universities, and
   cultural institutions are also pertinent to her work. While
   technologies change rapidly, the humanities provide a steady vantage
   point from which to view not just recent developments, but also those
   effaced by time and obsolescence. This long view of technology takes
   into account centuries old craft practices and the ideas associated
   with them in order to better assess and debate the sweeping changes in
   the nature of technology that are underway.

   At Yale, she has helped coordinate the Digital Humanities Working
   Group, an interdisciplinary working group at the [30]Whitney Humanities
   Center devoted to Yale’s growing digital humanities community.
   Carol’s current focus is on digital scholarship design and publishing
   in the humanities, data analysis and visualization, and the curation
   and deployment of linked open data in special collections.

   When not teaching or writing on the digital humanities or Italian
   literature, or taking advantage of Yale’s[31] special collections,
   she can sometimes be found on the beach in a small fishing village
   outside of Genoa, playing the card game [32]Scala quaranta.
