      <p>
        It's the first of the year and you know what that means: resolutions. One change I'm making this year is taking back my email address. For years one of the most important pieces of my personal identity has been in the control of a large corporation. While this hasn't posed...

        Recently I created a small Rails app as a sales/marketing site for the startup I am working at. The site is very basic with just a few models and controllers. We time came to deploy the site, Capistrano felt to big, but we didn't want to have to manually ssh...

        Recently after upgrading a Rails app to Rails 2.3.4 I noticed some calls from a SOAP service throwing errors.

        This week I was lucky enough to spend two days at the Merb Sprint. At the sprint I spent some time testing the install and setup process for the Merb Stack and merb_auth (the merb authentication gem). Dan Neighman (aka hassox) spent some time with me going over the merb_auth...

        Today I stumbled upon the first program I ever wrote. It's an interesting story looking back twenty years later. When I was somewhere between 8-10 years old my uncle gave my family our first computer, a Coleco Adam. Along with the computer we were given the now classic book BASIC...

        Recently, Merb has been getting a lot of attention. With significant changes leading up to the 1.0 release, and now with it's own conference, the Merb community needs a centralized place where relevant information can be found. Say hello to Merb Overheard. Merb Overheard follows the planet-type aggregation sites similar...

        One of the coolest things about Git is how easy it makes working with branches. Rails has been playing catch up with Git's distributed methodologies and recently took a nice step forward. Previously you could only use ./script/plugin install to install from the master branch of a Github repository. Now you...

        Recently I switched from Feather, a Merb blogging app, to Wordpress. Here is a small run down on why I made the switch. First off let me say this about Feather. It is an amazing application. I have contributed a bit to its development and can vouch on the quality...

        I recently added a couple of new tools to my project workflow, Hoptoad and Pivotal Tracker.

Hoptoad is a hosted solution that keeps track of duplicate bugs,...

        Often times I see something like some_file_bak or image.jpg.old in a repository. Renaming the original to a new file name only makes things more confusing because now the _bak file has no history. Trust you code control and use it as it is intended.
