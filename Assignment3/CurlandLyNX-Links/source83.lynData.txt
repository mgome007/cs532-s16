   The wolf from the shadows flashed through her mind, and her
   breath caught. Her grip tightened on the handle. Suddenly, the door
   swept open and a heavyset man with a white bakery box pushed past,
   wedging between her and the boy. She scooted inside the bakery and
   slammed the door at once, but when she peered out the window, the
   boy with the razor-sharp teeth had vanished. She pressed her nose to
   the glass. Where had he gone? She couldn’t even see the man with
   the bakery box, either. The entire street was empty.

   A cool breeze blew at her back, sending shivers along her skin.
   She spun around. The cakes and breads were gone and she now
   stood in a narrow room. If she spread her arms, she was sure she
   could touch both walls with her fingertips. Cages of birds lined the
   walls above, spiraling up to the endless ceiling, which seemed high
   enough to touch the stars. Golden canaries chirped noisily, pastel
   budgies paced their perches, pigeons cooed, and a raven peered at
   her through glassy eyes. It cawed, flapping its wings, and she jumped
   back, pressing her spine against the door.

   Candles set in brass sconces flickered dangerously close to the
   birds’ cages. A putrid odor, a mix of acrid bird crap and heavy
   patchouli
   incense, cut the air. Her hand scrabbled with the door handle, but the
   knob would not turn. She tugged harder. Her heart thrummed in her
   ears as the birds competed with chirps and whistles.

   As she reached to cover her ears, her elbow knocked the edge
   of one cage. It swung, and the budgies flapped their wings violently,
   swaying the cage. The budgerigars’ cage bumped the caged canaries
   and they too fluttered, so their cage knocked the finch’s cage
   beside it; and so like dominoes the cages were all set in motion with
   screeching birds.

   “Stop the racket or I’ll eat you all at once!” A bald woman, with skin
   so dark she could have been born of the night itself, pushed open a
   door across the room. Halen had not even noticed another entrance
   or exit amongst all the cages, yet there she stood, her golden eyes
   wide, scanning the birds, until her gaze settled on Halen. “What’s
   this we have here?”

   Her voice was husky and smoky, curling seductively, like a song
   to lure prey. It rang with familiarity in Halen’s mind, sending an
   earie
   chill in the marrow of her bones.

   Halen’s shoulder blades pressed harder against the glass as the
   woman stepped from the doorway. She wore a robe of purple silk that
   swept her ankles. Her dewy skin glistened in the dim flickers of light.
   Why had Asair’s instincts led her to this place? She was mistaken to
   trust his memories. Had he tricked her once more?

   “How did you summon this place?” the woman asked.

   Halen’s lips felt stitched, her throat dry. “I didn’t.” She cleared her
   throat. “I was hungry. I thought I would buy a treat.”

   The woman tilted her chin toward the birds. The dolman sleeve
   of her robe cascaded to her elbow as she stretched for the tarnished
   lock on one of the cages. Unlocking the latch with the hook of her
   long black fingernail, she reached inside. The budgerigar hopped
   onto her finger, pecking the tip of her dark nail. Being careful not to
   rock the cage, she coaxed the little bird out. Her eyes narrowed as
   she offered Halen the bird. “Is this your idea of a treat?”

[25]{Blog Tour} Twisted Sisters by Kimber Leigh Wheaton {Review + Giveaway}

   Posted on 8:00 AM by Voluptuous Book Diva





   It’s a child’s toy—what could go wrong?
   While playing with a spirit board, two sorority sisters summon the
   vindictive spirits of three women brutally murdered by a psychopath.
   Join Logan, Kacie, and the rest of the Orion Circle as they delve into
   the disturbing events of the past to find the key to freeing the
   spirits.

   But this isn’t any ordinary haunting.  These ghosts were banished
   before, and now they have returned more powerful than anyone could have
   imagined. Anger breeds hatred and hatred leads to darkness—these
   phantoms are on the verge of losing their last spark of humanity and
   becoming completely lost to the shadows.

   Can Logan and Kacie convince the tortured souls to embrace the light
   and move on, or will the spirits succumb to the hypnotic pull of evil,
   leading to an eternity of torment and suffering?

   I received an eARC when I signed up to host the book tour. I made no
   guarantee of a favorable review and the opinions expressed here are
   unbiased and my own.

   This is not a stand alone so Tortured Souls should be read first. This
   is a fast paced and exciting read full of paranormal elements and it
   contains just the right amount of romance to captivate you. The story
   line is well written and the characters are easy to relate to. The
   entire gang returns in this sequel plus a few new friends. Want to know
   what happens and what the consequences are for playing around with a
   ouija board? Then I highly recommend you read this YA book that's full
   of thrills and chills.

   I give this book:

[40]Spotlight on Author Shannon Avangeline {Interview, Review + Giveaway}

   Posted on 8:00 AM by Voluptuous Book Diva

   Coming from the south, some of her fondest memories are sitting on her
   Granny and Papa's front porch on summer nights listening to the adults
   share the stories of their childhoods. Her favorite were the spooky
   stories and local legends.

   Shannon had her first story 'published' when she was in first grade in
   a book that was made for the school board members of Surry County,
   North Carolina. Her epic tale of Sally, the red balloon was an instant
   elementary hit!

   Shannon lives with her husband, three boys, and two guinea pigs in
   Jonesville, N.C. When she is not writing, she enjoys spending time with
   friends and family, playing with her boys, reading, and shopping on
   Amazon. She lives a very normal, very un-glamorous, lifestyle that she
   loves. If you are in the area, you will probably find her volunteering
   at her children's school, in her minivan on the way to a band concert,
   or at the public library.

   She is an avid supporter and member of the Friends of the Jonesville
   Public Library, whose mission is to build a new library and to provide
   more community programs in a struggling economic demographic.

   Even though she is not a fan of television in general, in her spare
   time (like that ever happens) she enjoys binge watching on Netflix. Her
   favorite shows include The Vampire Diaries, Buffy the Vampire Slayer,
   Fringe, and Haven.



   I was afforded the opportunity to interview Shannon so let's take a
   look at her candid answers.


   What inspired you to be a writer?

   I’m not sure it was truly ever one thing that inspired me to be a
   writer. It was more like a combination of different things that came
   together. I remember passing people in cars or in a store and wondering
   what their lives were like. I have always been fascinated by the
   thought of what happens in other people’s lives when I’m not looking. I
   remember growing up in a family of “storytellers”. Some of my best
   memories from my childhood come from summer nights on my Granny and
   Papa’s front porch. These were my mother’s parents. I stayed with them
   while my mom was working. Unlike the homes of today, they had no phone
   (until my mother forced the issue when I was around four years old),
   the behemoth console television they owned only had four channels (if
   the weather held), no air conditioning, and they drove a pea green Ford
   Granada that smelled like tobacco and spearmint chewing gum.

   To say they lived simply is an understatement; however, this is where I
   started learning my craft. I was a chatty child, so to keep me
   entertained they made up stories. While we tended the garden, made
   meals, or they tried to convince me to nap my Granny would concoct epic
   tales about me and my cousins getting lost on the top of Pilot Mountain
   and being rescued by Bigfoot. These stories fueled my imagination, but
   my favorites came on the weekend nights. My mom, me, Granny, Papa, my
   uncle, aunt, and various degrees of kin would have a huge meal and then
   retire to the front porch to talk. This usually started as, “You
   remember that time?” or “Did you hear about John’s boy?”, but always
   ended up with them telling spooky stories from their youth. This is
   what I lived for! The tales of the ghosts and ghoulish things that they
   had seen in their lives. I think this more than anything fueled my love
   of all things paranormal.


   What genre/s do you write?

   First, it must be fiction! I mainly write YA; however, I do have a
   couple of NA books in the hopper. Paranormal is a personal favorite of
   mine, both to read and to write. I also love the contemporary college
   stories. No matter what the genre is, I have to be able to connect to
   the characters and care about their journey. The only genre I don’t
   think I could write would be historical romance, but I would never
   completely rule out any genre. Never say never!


   What draws you to this/these genres?

   The paranormal draw, again, goes back to my childhood. Things that are
   otherworldly have always intrigued me! Just the possibility of stepping
   away from the everyday world and opening that door to the “What if?”.
   The contemporary is the exact opposite! It is a chance to step away
   from the fanciful and dive head first in to gritty everyday problems.
   I don’t want to be pigeonholed into being just one thing. There are too
   many stories to tell.  I am a huge fangirl myself when it comes to
   certain authors. In YA, I love Becca Fitzpatrick, Cassandra Clare, and
   Maggie Steifvater. Some of my favorite NA authors are Jamie McGuire and
   Colleen Hoover. If you read more mature books like NA and enjoy a
   wicked twist, I love Teresa Mummert.


   Tell us a bit about your two main characters?

   Paige is every displaced, sixteen year old who feels like the ugly
   duckling. Due to some bad decisions on her mother’s part, she is moving
   once again. She is the kind of person who feels the responsibility of
   the world on her shoulders; however, she would prefer to handle
   everything out of the limelight.  She’s a little awkward, but she is a
   good person who loves her friends and family fiercely. Overnight, she
   is forced to learn how to go from being ordinary to extraordinary! She
   also has some tough choices to make when it comes to love. She has to
   learn to trust herself and see “people” for whom, not what they are.

   Lucian (Luc) is more of a mystery. He hates what he is. He feels not
   only the responsibility for others, but a deep seeded guilt as well.
   Luc’s biggest obstacle is overcoming his own self-loathing enough to
   let someone inside past the walls he has built around his heart. He
   feels unworthy of love for himself, but he loves BIG! He is funny,
   sexy, and I fell in love with him before I had even written the first
   words of Incandescent. By around the fourth chapter, he became my
   forever book boyfriend!


   How much research do you do?

   I think that depends on the story. I always want there to be an
   authenticity to my stories, and I would never want to write about a
   place or a thing and have the readers unable to recognize and have a
   personal connection with what I’m talking about. For example if you
   wrote a story about my tiny hometown and described the skyscrapers, I
   would close the book and never pick it back up! No matter how good a
   story is, no matter the genre, there has to be enough fact to make the
   fiction believable. Once I started Incandescent, I soon realized there
   was an extraordinary amount of research to do. It turned out to be more
   than I could have ever imagined!


   Do you aim for a set amount of words/pages per day?

   NO! I’m a pantser, not a plotter. Usually, I start with an idea and it
   shapes itself as the characters tell their story. I stop and do
   research when something doesn’t feel right or I feel that I need more
   substance to support the story. In addition, I have a husband, three
   children, and I’m still terrified to let go of my day job. I never post
   a pre-order date until the book is finished. Under coming attractions
   on my website, there are approximate dates for releases, but even that
   has a disclaimer about the author’s mood and schedule.


   What was the hardest thing about writing your latest book?

   Publishing it! I have written other things in the past that have fallen
   to the wayside out of fear. It is a difficult thing to put your heart
   and soul out for the world to judge. I probably would have never had
   the courage if it had not been for my best friend, Melissa. She was the
   first one to read anything from Incandescent. I remember having a
   conversation with her where she paid me the greatest compliment ever.
   When I asked her if it sucked, and she is totally the type that will
   tell you yes if it does, she told me that after the first few chapters
   she had forgotten that I was the one who wrote it. Without knowing, she
   gave me the confidence to take a chance and publish.


   If we Googled your name what would we see?

   Not much, I’m afraid. Just the links for my website, book, and various
   social media accounts. Of course, I had to look!


   If you had to describe yourself using three words they would be?

   Loyal, Loving, Procrastinator (which is not fun on a deadline!!)


   What’s the current color of your hair?

   Medium auburn by choice, not nature.


   Name one thing that drives you crazy.

   People who are needlessly rude or cruel! That’s not cool.


   Describe your favorite pair of pajamas.

   The top is a red Mickey Mouse t shirt with white capris that have
   Mickey heads all over them.


   What would you do if you won $20 million?

   Donate a lot to charity. I have several charities that are near and
   dear to my heart, especially Autism research. Two of my three sons are
   on the Autism spectrum. I would build my tiny town a library and make
   it a memorial to my Granny. I would spend an obscene amount on books.
   Move my best friend next door to me instead of 8 hours away. Go on a
   trip around the world with my family and my best friend’s family, and
   end up on a tropical beach for a few years. Build my mama the house of
   her dreams and buy her a new car! I could go on and on… So, I’d
   probably be broke before long!


   Do you have any quirky habits?

   Ok, my husband laughs at me every time a new book comes out that I want
   to read from a series. The reason being, I cannot just read the new
   book. I have to go back and re-read the entire series up to that point
   before I can read the new release. No big deal, right? At one time, I
   was obsessed with Christine Feehan’s Dark series. There are over 20
   books so far in that series and she is still writing. I had to give it
   up. I may go back one day and finish if she ever stops writing the
   series. It’s only one of my many quirks, but probably the weirdest!


   I want to thank Shannon for taking the time to answer these questions
   which give us a closer look at not only her but also the inner workings
   of her writting.


   Here's her book Incandescent.




   What if you had a destiny you knew nothing about?

   What if it was to kill the boy you love?

   Being sixteen is hard. Paige Thornton doesn’t even feel like she
   belongs in her own family! So she really shouldn’t be that upset that
   her flighty mom has uprooted her and her twin sisters again to drag
   them to live with their Grams in Seahaven, NC. However, Seahaven is
   full of surprises for Paige. A new school, a gorgeous new boy, and a
   magical heritage that she had no idea about. But somehow this boy, Luc,
   is too perfect.

   Lucian Burke knows that he shouldn’t let himself get too close to
   Paige. He’s only supposed to watch her and report back. Unfortunately,
   things don’t always go as planned. As long as he keeps his distance,
   things will be fine.

   What will happen to this modern day Romeo and Juliet?

   Will they ever find their happiness, or will it all end in blood and
   ashes?




   [41]Amazon



   I came across this book while perusing through my newsfeed on a social
   media site and so I borrowed it via KU. Definitely one of the best
   things I've done so far this year. Paige is barely sixteen years old
   but she is mom to her twin sisters and even to her own mom Marlene.
   After her mother divorces step dad number two they go to live with her
   grandmother Sadie who's more than what she appears to be and it doesn't
   take long for Paige to learn some startling things about herself and
   the world that she lives in.

   This well written plot is off to an amazing start full of witches,
   vampires, angels and first love. The characters are so well developed
   that they practically jump right out of the pages and immediately
   capture your full attention. I practically screamed when I reached the
   last page simply because the author left me wanting more!! I simply
   cannot wait for book two because I am dying to find out what's in store
   for Paige and Luc.

   I give this book:
