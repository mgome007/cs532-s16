    “Adam and I have been with Laura’s Critter Care for almost three
    years now. We have had and continue to have a fabulous experience
    with top notch service from Laura and her entire team!




    Laura’s Critter Care was recommended by a dear friend because in 2013
    our 18 year old cocker spaniel Sasha was having a rough time. Sasha
    needed a lot of extra care while Adam and I were at work. They
    all took such special care of Sasha and it was such a relief for Adam
    and I to have trusted caretakers. Laura was Sasha’s snuggle buddy;
    Miranda was Sasha’s dog whisperer who calmed Sasha when she was in
    pain and Marilyn was Sasha’s playmate who kept up Sasha’s spirits and
    ours too with cute notes about Sasha. Sasha was a tough cookie who
    fought her way to the end but the LLC team loved her and cared for
    her right to Rainbow Bridge. They also lovingly cared for Adele our
    other cocker. No matter how many visits or how long we needed them to
    help with Sasha – Laura, Miranda and Marilyn always found a way to
    always cover the visits. We wouldn’t have had as much extra “time”
    with Sasha if we hadn’t had LCC’s help.




    Adam and I are at times called away for work and Laura always finds
    us coverage for the “doggie girls” which helps us carry on with our
    work knowing our girls are being cared for just like we care for
    them. They also take special care of Adele our other cocker. And
    after Sasha passed – everyone kept Adele active and moving so she
    wasn’t as sad losing her pal Sasha. Marilyn even invented a way to
    get Adele running – which she doesn’t do! She tied her stuffed dog to
    a leash and got Adele chasing the stuff dog in the back yard. We’ve
    now added two more pals for Adele – Cabo and. And now each of our
    girls receive special attention during their visits ensuring each
    dogs “favorite” pastime is enjoyed! I cannot say enough good things
    about Laura, Miranda and Marilyn; they always make sure the girls
    have treats, remember their birthdays, help us with eye drops and ear
    cleanings and other medical needs (our pooches are older so need
    help). They follow instructions and ask questions and we trust them
    1000% with our babes.




    As two working professionals, knowing our babes are cared for by LCC
    while we are at work or traveling, is incredible. The quality of the
    service is not something we ever expected to find. We are incredibly
    thankful and grateful for Laura, Bill, Miranda and Marilyn.




    Laura keeps her clients very well informed. She not only sends out
    information about how to keep your pet healthy and safe but also
    sends out special literature and announcements about weather
    conditions and unique pet related issues that may arise during
    holidays! All helpful and useful information for pet owners. Laura as
    a business owner treats her customers like she would want to be
    treated and that is VERY rare these days.




    Laura runs a incredibly professional organization. When we met Laura
    for the first time and she brought her formal contract, and advised
    us about her organization, we were incredibly impressed. Now years
    later, we remain impressed. Laura is incredibly responsive,
    organized, and professional and so is all of her staff. Laura’s
    Critter Care, LLC receives our highest recommendation for pet care
    services and are very glad she was recommended to us.” ~Lorrie
    Turner-Benigni, General Counsel and Senior Director of Legal @ New
    Era Cap & Adam Benigni, Sports Director/Anchor for WGRZ (NBC) Buffalo

   At Laura’s Critter Care, LLC, it is understood that your pets are very
   important members of your family.  That is why I am devoted to
   providing exceptional pet and home care that is guaranteed to exceed
   your expectations.  I believe that pets should be spoiled with the
   things that they desire – love, attention, exercise, mental
   stimulation, and the best possible care!

   Allowing your pets to stay in the comfort of their own environment will
   eliminate the stress of relocating to a kennel or boarding facility.
   When pets are able to stay home and keep their normal routine it
   greatly reduces the stress and anxiety they may feel about your
   absence. With today’s hectic schedules, you can’t always rely on
   friends, family, or neighbors to be able to care for your pets or
   home the way you would like. Fully bonded and insured Professional Pet
   and Home Sitters take their job very seriously.

   Laura’s Critter Care, LLC offers many services in addition to pet
   sitting, such as house sitting, dog walking, bird sitting, pet bathing,
    litter box maintenance, pet waste removal, pet taxi service, dog park
   field trips, horse care and more. Check out the [20]services/rates page
