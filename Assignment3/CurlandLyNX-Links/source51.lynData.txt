The Complete Ruby Developer

   [12][ruby.PNG]
   Course Description
   This course is for you if…
   You have been putting off learning to program because it seems
   intimidating.
   You have tried to learn to program before, but stopped because you
   didn’t know where to proceed after the tutorial.
   You have built a Ruby on Rails app through another tutorial, but have
   no idea what the code is doing.
   You are an entrepreneur or aspiring entrepreneur and you want to build
   an MVP, but don’t know where to get started to learn to program.
   How I go about presenting the information:
   Quick explanations of concepts with code walkthroughs. A lot of courses
   go into mundane drawn out explanations that are unnecessary and lose
   the student, I do the opposite, get straight to the point and show you
   how it works, then move on. You can revisit or rewind for refreshers
   and not have to worry about where in the 20 minute video that one piece
   of context was discussed.

Sensu - Introduction

   [20][sensu.PNG]
   Course Description
   Sensu is a powerful Next-Generation monitoring framework that is
   quickly replacing traditional monitoring systems like Zabbix, Icinga,
   and Nagios.
   But diving into a new monitoring system can be difficult without a
   guide to show you the way! This course can be your guide to
   understanding how Sensu works and how to deploy it to your
   infrastructure.
   This introductory course will teach you the basics of Sensu's
   architecture and how to take advantage of the flexibility it provides
   to build awesome systems.
   Contents
   In-depth architectural overview
   All videos closed-captioned in English. Hear and See for optimal
   learning!
   Step-by-step howto instructions on getting Sensu up and running
   Leverage your existing Nagios plugins written in C, Python, or Bash
   Take advantage of the plethora of Open Source Sensu plugins in Ruby!
   Learn about RabbitMQ, Redis, Ruby Gems, Sensu's API, and more
   Use Uchiwa, the awesome open source Dashboard for Sensu
   Setup the foundation to build on more intermediate and advanced Sensu
   topics
   When you are finished with this course you will have setup a complete
   monitoring solution that actually checks things and actually sends
   email. This is not a theoretical course, it is a practical one that
   leaves you with skills and infrastructure to build upon.
   Let Me Make The Mistakes For You
   It's one thing to read docs and get perfect copy-paste command line
   examples that work. It is another thing to be in real life watching a
   real engineer fight a live system and try to get it working! I
   purposely make mistakes just to demonstrate what happens when things go
   wrong. That gives me an excuse to troubleshoot the problem and then
   solve it. Then, when you encounter that same mistake in your
   infrastructure, you will know exactly what to do!
   For Dev and Ops Alike
   Sysadmins, Devops Practitioners, Infrastructure engineers, SREs, and
   simply curious software engineers should take this course to better
   their craft and learn more about what makes Sensu special. It is not
   your grandfather's monitoring system. It is a modern, scalable,
   flexible monitoring system with a great API to integrate with your
   infrastructure.
   Even if you don't end up using Sensu in Production, taking this course
   will still level-up your monitoring game, by increasing the scope of
   your DevOps toolbox. So enroll today and check it out!

Crash Course: Virtualization with VMWare Fusion 8.0

   [22][crash.PNG]
   Course Description
   *This is a Mac specific course. I will create a Windows version soon.*
   Virtualization may be a new term to you, but it is becoming an
   important one. Whether you are a curious high school student wanting to
   try your hand at a Linux operating system, or an advanced individual
   working for an IT department in a large company, you can benefit from
   knowing how to properly setup a virtual computer system or network.
   This will be a crash course on the topic but you will be outfitted with
   the skills and tools needed to progress into more advanced information
   and with the right resources, setup a complete virtual computer lab in
   your home.
   Best student for the course:
   This course is an introduction to virtualization and a program called
   VMWare Fusion. Having no prior knowledge of what virtualization is will
   not limit your potential at learning this course, however it is
   recommended that you have prior knowledge in:
   Operating System installation
   Optimizing a Windows computer
   Managing resources on a computer

Windows 10 Primer

   [24][windows.PNG]
   Course Description
   NOTE: Windows 10 is in its beta distributions so this course is
   ever-changing with new releases and will be updated multiple times.
   I love Windows 8.1! It has everything I need EXCEPT ONE THING: Start
   Menu! They say Microsoft generates a lovely operating system EVERY
   OTHER VERSION! And Windows 10 is going to be just that: the best
   Windows of all. And it is!
   If you follow me in this crash course you will see the reason:
   There is a new start menu here that has the best of the two worlds! It
   lists the application in two pages, one start menu pinned applications
   and the other, applications arranged in folders. This is what we had
   seen in Windows 7.
   Apps open as desktop applications! Those of you who used to hate apps
   now will use them more frequently.
   In Start menu you can have app view that has tiles that can be re-sized
   and they are live!
   You have features such as Task View (although not so impressive) that
   gives you the option of grouping your open applications.
   and a lot of other improvements are here.
   In this course I will show you:
   how to personalize your desktop and use task view to organize your open
   applications into groupings
   how to customize the new windows 10 star menu and of course the
   shortcut menu that opens with right clicking the start button
   how to work with file explorer and perform basic and advanced operation
   on files and folders
   how to manage users and groups on your system and implement security
   features to protect your files and folders
   how to share folders over network and set permissions on them
   how to change file attributes, encrypt or compress data or encrypt the
   whole drive
   how to backup and restore files and folders and check different
   versions of them
   and some miscelaneous topics
   So stay tuned and follow me!

Cyber Criminals Want Your Information: Stop Them Cold!

   [26][cyber.PNG]
   Course Description
   Let's face it - life on the Internet means usernames and passwords
   (accounts)! Lots of them in fact!
   Stop and think about it for a moment. How many sites do you login into
   daily, weekly, or monthly?
   Social media: Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, Skype, Pinterest,
   Instragram, Youtube...
   Ecommerce: Amazon, eBay, Overstock, Newegg, Target, Walmart...
   Online Banking: Paypal, Bank Of America, Wells Fargo, Sun Trust,
   Charles Schwab...
   Email: Gmail, Yahoo! Mail, Hotmail, your ISP email...
   Gaming: Xbox Live!, Playstation, Wii, Steam....
   The above list is only a small sample of sites you probably use on a
   regular basis. In fact many people have over one hundred accounts and
   that list is growing all the time!
   How do you keep track of all this information?
   Use the same few passwords among your accounts
   Keep a spreadsheet
   Write them down on paper
   List them on a word processing document
   Stick notes on your monitor
   Unfortunately none of those are good practices. That's right - none of
   them. For the best security you should have a different password for
   every account (site)! These passwords should also be stored in an
   encrypted and safe manner.
   Now why should you use a different password? You have heard of massive
   data breaches haven't you? Where cyber criminals steal thousands,
   hundreds of thousands, or even millions of account information? It has
   happened to many sites including Adobe, eBay, Twitter, and many many
   others.
   If your Twitter and bank passwords are the same and the cyber criminals
   steal your Twitter password, guess what? They could now potentially
   access your bank account! That would be a nightmare.
   So every account on every site should have a unique password. After
   all, the username is usually your email address so in most cases your
   account is only protected by your password. However, there is more to
   this puzzle.
   You should make your password as difficult for the cyber criminals to
   guess as possible. That means quit using video123 and use something
   like R-'hJ@y|11_b@i&U%RfB-z`J7ZF0d":blJg"ksUg which is far more secure.
   Now you are probably wondering: how in the world do I have a unique
   long password for every site and easily keep track of all this
   information? Well, you are in the right place. That is the whole point
   of this Udemy course.
   Your instructor, Jeremy O'Connell, will explain with videos how you
   secure your digital accounts and better protect yourself from cyber
   criminals. So the next time when you hear on the news of some site
   being hacked and millions of accounts being stolen you will know your
   accounts are safe and changing that site's password is no big deal.
   What are you waiting for?! This course is even free, so put away your
   wallet!
