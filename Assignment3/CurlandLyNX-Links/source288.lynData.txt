What can we help with?

     * Web Development
       HTML or Javascript code? We eat, sleep, and breathe code. We are
       equipped with the tools to ensure your website is user-friendly,
       innovative and optized for Search Engines. We build smart platforms
       following the MVC design pattern using NodeJS.
     * Design Thinking
       Your website may be the first interaction a customer has with your
       brand. We design websites that parallel your brand and tell your
       story in a thoughtful way. From campaign landing pages to
       multi-functional corporate web sites to e-commerce websites, our
       creative engineering efforts will enliven your brand - across a
       wide range of devices.

     * Mobile Development
       In a world where smartphone use is rising exponentially, the
       opportunities to make a name for yourself, not to mention a ton of
       money, by turning your app idea into reality are huge. So whether
       you're building for Android or iOS, we may help you with that.
     * Database design
       A well structured Database Model is the basis for performant, fast
       and scalable web applications and mobile apps. We create the
       database scheme due to your requirements. We support graph database
       (NEO4j), relational database (mySQL) and document database
       (MongoDB). We provide an extensive documentation to the database
       model.

     * SEO & Marketing
       We analyze spendings on marketing campaigns and how much traffic
       you get from paid and unpaid channels and optimize them. Also, we
       help you increase organic traffic by making your website search
       engines friendly and help you to engage your followers on social
       media.
