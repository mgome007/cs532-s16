   All our rabbits are neutered, vaccinated and micro-chipped before they
   find a new home.
   If bunnies arrive in pairs/groups we will try to keep them together but
   sometimes it isn't possible.
   We do home checks before you can adopt from us, don't worry this is not
   a test and you cannot fail! as long as you take any advice we give
   regarding your housing/care for your prospective rabbits there should
   be no reason for you to not pass a home check!
   We provide a bonding service for bunnies where you can leave your bun
   with us to bond with one of our rescues. There will be a small charge
   for this for lodging and time spent bonding.
   We are always available after you have adopted from us for advice and
   if you can no longer care for your bunny we will re-home them for you.
   The cost of adopting a single bunny from us is £40, a pair £70. This
   price includes the cost of neutering/vaccinations/micro-chipping and
   room and board!
   So as you can see the adoption price is minimal compared to the actual
   cost to us to help and rehome these bunnies.
   We welcome any donations above the adoption price and all our
   money goes straight back into caring for the rescue rabbits.
   We make no profit or gain in anyway from this rabbit rescue we do it
   for the love of bunnies!!!
   If you would like to adopt from us feel free to contact us via
   e-mail/facebook or phone.
   Thanks for looking at our website we hope to speak to you soon!
