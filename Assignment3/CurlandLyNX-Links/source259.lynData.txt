   I'm Nadia and I offer detailed astrology and Tarot readings, just for
   you.  My style is direct and practical: black coffee instead of lattes.
   You can read more about me [32]here[33], including my Terms of Service.

   Stay updated on all my services and blog posts by subscribing via email
   (form is located at the bottom of this page).

   I do consultations by email (nadiagilchrist@gmail.com) or Skype. Book
   an [34]astrology reading[35], or a [36]Tarot reading.
