   [8]Launch - Interview with the Author
   What do you hope readers take with them after they’ve read it?
   I hope readers take away that we can each do hard things; that we don’t
   have to let others’ imposed stereotypes have sway in our lives or our
   hearts. Also, no matter where we are, the Lord is aware of us.
   [9]Heidi Reads... - Review

   of action and adventure kept the pace moving and I couldn't put the
   book down. Highly recommend!"

   "With its epic scope and beautiful writing, The Express Rider's Lady
   ranks among the best of Love Inspired books that I've ever read. I’m
   glad to have discovered the writing of Stacy Henrie."
   [12]Katie's Clean Book Collection - Review
   "I enjoyed the descriptions and characters in this sweet historical
   story. I've always been a bit fascinated with the Pony Express and how
   their system worked. Imagining the speed, danger, and dedication these
   riders experienced is exciting and I loved getting a taste of that."
   [13]Min Reads and Reviews - Review
   "This book is pretty much close to perfect. . . . Stacy does an amazing
   job in writing this era. The setting itself is a character. I really
   enjoyed this book."
   [14][Teaser%2B3.jpg]
   [15]Babs Book Bistro - Review
   "A great read and page turner. I did not want to put the book down. I
   had to see of the Pony Express could pull this off. The characters work
   well together and a nice sweet story."
   [16]Savings in Seconds - Review
   "As the characters encounter situations both perilous and mundane, they
   must learn to work together. . . . I enjoyed the banter between the
   characters, too. The story has a strong faith element, hidden behind
   the scenes."
   [17]Literary Time Out - Review
   "I loved this book. The story was great, and moved along at a good
   clip. . . . I would definitely read this again, and highly recommend it
   to anyone who loves historical romance. Hopefully you will love
   Delsie's grit, and Myles character just like I did."

   Myles Patton is a rider for the newly created Pony Express, riding the
   trail from St. Joseph, Missouri to Guittard’s home station in Kansas
   and back. And while he has a way with horses, his people skills are a
   bit lacking. . . . the more Delsie learns to handle herself in the
   saddle and on the trail, her confidence begins to grow. She’s stronger
   than she ever thought she was—and her feelings for Myles are growing
   stronger too.

   [23]Mom with a Reading Problem - Review
   "The Express Rider’s Lady by [24]Stacy Henrie is such an endearing,
   heart-warming romance with adventure and the lure of the wild west! . .
   . Overall I really enjoyed this book. It was easy for me to get lost in
   their adventure. I honestly didn’t want to stop reading! If you enjoy
   inspirational romance, than I highly recommend you get a copy of this
   book.
   [25]Backing Books - Review
   "The premise was not one I had heard of before and, while it did seem a
   little far fetched, it was fun and interesting. I liked Delsie's
   determination to make things right with her sister and her willingness
   to do most anything to make it happen."
   [26]Seasons of Humility - Review
   "This has to be one of the best Love Inspired books I've read to date.
   The Express Rider's Lady is just my type of story: a Western journey
   with a delightful mixture of humor, peril, and tender romance. I truly
   enjoyed the adventure!"

   Adventurous Spirit
   Express riders had to be adventurers at heart. To face what they did
   daily, in order to deliver the mail, they must have thrilled at the
   prospect of conquering danger over and over again. They didn’t observe
   life from the safety of the sidelines—they threw themselves into the
   fray and made a name for themselves that has endured.
   [29]Singing Librarian Books - Review
   "Fun characters and a wonderful plot, readers will not want to put this
   novel down. I would recommend this novel to readers of historical
   romance."
   [30]Christy's Cozy Corners - Review
   "Like all good romance stories, this one is full of sweet moments and
   crazy moments too. The trip has a lot of action and the characters are
   ones you will fall in love with while you are reading. I love the
   ending of the story! If you’re a fan of clean, Christian romance, you
   will definitely love The Express Rider’s Lady."
   [31]Mel's Shelves - Five Reasons Why Being a Pony Express Rider Was the
   Ultimate in Adventure Professions
   [32][pony%2Bexpress%2Bposter.jpg]
   With only a trusty steed and a pistol or two for companions, Express
   riding was not for the lonely or afraid. Riders would spend hours in
   the saddle, only encountering people at stops every twelve to twenty
   miles, and then for just a few brief minutes as the mail saddle was
   thrown onto the back of a fresh mount. A number of riders were also
   orphans with little or no family waiting for them back at their home
   base.
   [33]Getting Your Read On - Review
   "Stacy Henrie did a fantastic job of giving her characters depth and
   humanity. Their stories unfold gently and I felt like I was right there
   getting to know them. . . . I really loved this book. It was a great
   western historical fiction."

   I used a hard copy map, one which included the entire Pony Express
   trail on it, to mark where Delsie and Myles would be stopping each
   night. Not only did this help me know which home stations they would be
   lodging in, but I was also able to see which prominent settlements or
   landmarks they would pass by on a given day. All the stations mentioned
   in the book were actually used by the Pony Express.
   "A truly sweet historical with some surprising twists and turns. . . .
   If you are looking for an exciting and romantic reading escape into the
   Old West days gone by, you should definitely check out Stacy Henrie's
   appealing story The Express Rider's Lady."
   [37]Dixie n Dottie - Review
   "This was a beautifully written story that involves a lot of adventure,
   trust, love and experiencing the unknown. . . . Anyone who enjoys
   reading historical fiction with adventure and romance should read this
   book. You will love it! "
   [38][Teaser%2B1.jpg]
   [39]Reading Is My SuperPower - Review
   "The Express Rider’s Lady by Stacy Henrie not only provides a sweet
   romance but also gives readers a compelling glimpse into the perilous
   conditions once common to cross terrain we now take for granted. Smooth
   writing, vivid settings, and heartstopping action bring the characters
   and the history to life. A quick read, as typical to the Love Inspired
   line, but very entertaining!"

   Delsie Radford, the heroine of THE EXPRESS RIDER’S LADY, must travel

   her sister’s wedding. But would such a feat have been possible?
   [43]Rockin' Book Reviews - Review
   "This is a slightly predictable, but heart-wrenching, story with enough
   twists and adventure to keep the reader's attention. It also teaches a
   few good lessons on misconceptions most experienced in life."

   Westward Wedding Journey
   Delsie Radford is going to make it to California, no matter the danger
   or difficulty. Her father may have kept her and her sister apart, but
   Delsie refuses to miss her sister's wedding—even with only eighteen
   days to get there. And she's found the perfect escort in Pony Express
   rider Myles Patton.
   Myles can't believe it when a pretty socialite hires him to take her
   cross-country through rough terrain and dangerous territory. Surely
   she'll quit before they reach their destination—he's known girls like
   her before. But the longer they ride together, the more Myles notices
   Delsie's toughness and kindness beneath her polished exterior. And
   though they may be worlds apart…they might just be perfect for each
   other.

   Introduction to the Book
   It’s wintertime in Rankins, so…
   Let’s celebrate! I know, I know, you’ve had enough of winter, right?
   Those of you who live in the eastern half of the continent or some
   other snowy place have probably quit reading already. But on the
   off-chance that you’re still with me, let’s talk about it. I’ll start
   with my own confession: I don’t really like winter. Truth be known, I’m
   a bit of sunshine junkie. I don’t like to lay in the sun. I’m more of a
   hike on a sunny day, working outdoors, or hanging out by the water kind
   of girl. You know – a sun in the shade kind of person.
   So after writing about every season that Alaska has to offer, I was
   nervous to set a book entirely during the winter. (Mountains Apart also
   took place in the winter, but the heroine in that book, Emily,
   certainly didn’t embrace it. She hated it. Of course, she didn’t like
   Rankins either when she first got there.) To me, winter is such a huge
   part of Alaska’s image. I was afraid I wouldn’t be able to do it
   justice.
   I thought about my own strategy for surviving winter. Escaping to
   Hawaii being cost prohibitive, I opt to get out and do something in
   spite of the weather. For me, this means bundling up and taking a hike,
   or, if I’m really lucky, skiing. Obviously, this isn’t something I can
   do every day, but it gives me something to look forward to during the
   often-dreary days of winter. It’s a way to face it, to embrace the cold
   and turn it into something fun. That’s when it hit me. That’s exactly
   what Alaskans do. They take the cold, the snow, the ice and the dark
   and use it to their advantage. And in some of the most incredibly
   creative ways (more about this in a future blog). That’s the route I
   opted for in A Family Like Hannah’s.
   Hannah and Tate embrace the winter – she’s a skier and he’s a
   snowboarder. I tried to put them outdoors as much as I could – skiing,
   snowboarding, sledding, snowshoeing. There’s even a bonfire, and plenty
   of hot chocolate. And always, at the forefront of the story, is Snowy
   Sky Resort – the business whose future they are battling over.
   A Family Like Hannah’s is my version of an Alaskan winter - and more
   specifically - a wintertime in Rankins. On each stop of the tour, I’ve
   tried to infuse some of this enduring and inspiring winter spirit
   Alaskans seem to so easily embrace. Hope you enjoy!
   — Carol

   February 17th 2016
   [134][Add+to+Goodreads+Button.png]
   Is it too late for second chances when the girl you loved in your youth
   comes back into your life?
   Gerolt de Warenne became guardian to a child-heiress named Cassandry
   when he was only nineteen-years old. As he watched her grow into a
   lovely young woman, he found himself falling in love with her, but
   Cassandry viewed him as an older brother. So, burying his feelings, he
   gave permission for her to marry another.
   Twenty-four years later Gerolt and Cassandry meet again. With the loss
   of their respective spouses, Gerolt hopes to finally court Cassandry,
   but she desires to remain a widow. Instead, they agree to a betrothal
   of their children.
   Matters become complicated as their friendship begins to evolve into
   the romance Gerolt has always wanted. But by the law of the medieval
   Church, Cassandry and Gerolt can’t marry if their children do. Can they
   find a way to be together? Or must they sacrifice their future for the
   love of their children?
   "Courting Cassandry" is a “Hearts in Autumn” romance, medieval romances
   revolving around heroes and heroines “in the autumn of their years.”
   Because love isn’t only for the young!

   Sir Balduin de Soler gave up long ago on love. He never had the means
   to support a wife until an unexpected advancement in his fifties allows
   him to reassess his future just as the lovely Lucianna enters his
   life.
   Lucianna Fabio harbors a secret, painful memory from her past that has
   kept her unwed, as well. Now in her forties, she thought herself too
   old to marry until she meets Sir Balduin. Now suddenly their lonely
   autumn lives feel very much like spring again . . . until Lucianna’s
   brother appears without warning and threatens to revive the secret that
   will destroy Lucianna’s second chance at love.
   "Loving Lucianna" is the first in Joyce DiPastena’s new "Hearts in
   Autumn" romance series, medieval romances revolving around heroes and
   heroines “in the autumn of their years.” Because you’re never too old

   [146][Joyce%2BDipastena.jpg] Joyce DiPastena dreamed of green medieval
   forests while growing up in the dusty copper mining town of Kearny,
   Arizona. She filled her medieval hunger by reading the books of Thomas
   B. Costain (where she fell in love with King Henry II of England), and
   later by attending the University of Arizona where she graduated with a
   degree in history, specializing in the Middle Ages. The university was
   also where she completed her first full-length novel…set, of course, in
   medieval England. Later, her fascination with Henry II led her to
   expand her research horizons to the far reaches of his “Angevin Empire”
   in France, which became the setting of her first published novel,
   Loyalty’s Web (a 2007 Whitney Award Finalist).
   When she’s not writing, Joyce loves to read, play the piano, and spend
   time with her sister and friends. A highlight of her year is attending
   the annual Arizona Renaissance Festival .
   Joyce is a multi-published, multi-award winning author who specializes
   in sweet medieval romances heavily spiced with mystery and adventure.
   She lives with her two cats, Clio and Glinka Rimsky-Korsokov, in Mesa,
   Arizona.

[162]We're sharing the Grand Finale for THE SUNPENNY TOUR & EBOOK SALE!

   [163][Sunpenny%2BBanner.jpg]
   On Tour with [164]Prism Book Tours.
   Prism Tour Grand Finale for
   Someday, Maybe by Jenny Piper
   &
   The Long Way Home by Janet Purcell
   If you missed the inspiration behind these books or reading their first
   chapters, go back and do so now...
   [165]Bookworm Lisa - Inspiration for The Long Way Home
   "The Long Way Home began germinating in my mind after I visited the
   Andrew Wyeth exhibition at the Philadelphia Museum of Art and studied
   the paintings on display about which I would write a review in my
   weekly fine arts column in the Times of Trenton newspaper. The image of
   Christina Olson dragging herself uphill in Wyeth’s painting Christina’s
   World haunted me. I saw it as a figurative painting and yet as a still
   life. Her life had been stilled by her unexplained disability."
   [166]Beck Valley Books - Excerpt from The Long Way Home
   Callie screamed and jumped back. She ran out of the room, slammed the
   door and, with all her weight against it, looked frantically around for
   some way to keep it shut. There was nothing. The door didn’t have a
   lock and there was no furniture close enough to push against it.
   [167]Christy's Cozy Corners - Time Passes
   "Time passing is something that is an integral part of the story in
   ‘Someday, Maybe’ and in ‘Moving On’, too. We never know what is going
   to happen to us. Everything changes – or does it?"
   [168]I Am A Reader - Excerpt from Someday, Maybe
   When he’d first seen her, a neat, spriggy little thing, she had worn
   her hair in tight, dark pigtails, and he’d liked that. When she had
   grown up and had it cut in a fashionable sort of style he’d been a bit
   disconcerted, but as time had gone on she had let it grow a bit and
   some- times put it up so that it sat on her head like a plump, soft,
   scented cloud, and he had loved it. Today, so early in the morning, it
   was tousled, unwashed and unbrushed and smelled of the cold morning and
   of chicken feed, but he didn’t care. He adored it.

   The Long Way Home
   by Janet Purcell
   Adult Fiction
   Paperback & ebook, 237 pages
   April 7th 2015 by Sunpenny Publishing
   [176][Add+to+Goodreads+Button.png]
   When Callie Vinerelli gives refuge in her Cape Cod home to a storm
   ravaged stranger, the hidden secres of her house on the dunes begin to
   emerge. She becomes enmeshed in the violence and tragedy of the past
   that left accomplished artist Christina Burroughs a paraplegic and
   stole her beloved daughter from her. Those still unresolved events
   invade Callie's life, causing chaos and intrigue, life changing
   relationships, justice and peace to Christina's descendants -and new
   love to herself.

   by Jenny Piper
   Adult Fiction
   Paperback & ebook, 306 pages
   November 6th 2013 by Sunpenny Limited
   [181][Add+to+Goodreads+Button.png]
   In a ramshackle old cottage with an outside lav, and a rickety ladder
   up to a draughty attic bedroom, Jim and Mary Norris slog in all
   weathers to make a living from their market garden, and to bring up
   their little girl, Patsy. But at times Jim’s guilt is overwhelming as
   he watches his beloved Mary working her frozen fingers to the bone,
   almost dropping with weariness – not exactly what she’s been used to in
   her genteel upbringing as the niece of well- off local gentry, who cut
   her off when she married “beneath her”. But she never complains; she
   loves Jim madly and they are blissfully happy together.
   Until her accident – and the nightmare that follows them all through
   the next 30 years. Mary’s gradual descent into madness overshadows even
   Jim’s second marriage and children, but the shocking climax is
   something no-one could have foreseen.

   Starting over is serious business
   With her professional skiing career cut short by an accident, Hannah
   James is putting all her energy into transforming Snowy Sky Resort into
   something special. There's only one obstacle. Famous
   pro-snowboarder-turned-consultant Tate Addison has his own ideas about
   taking the Rankins, Alaska, lodge to the next level. But Hannah won't
   compromise her dreams. She gets that Tate is trying to create a stable
   home for his orphaned six-year-old nephew—a boy Hannah already adores.
   And if she isn't careful, she could also fall for the boy's
   too-attractive uncle. Is she risking heartbreak? Or do she and Tate
   really want the same things out of life?
