     COVER REVEAL: AERIE by Maria Dahvana Headley

     Get ready to sail back to the world of Magonia because the stunning
     sequel AERIE is headed to a sky near you this Fall! But while we
     wait, let’s look at some gorgeous covers!

     If you don’t remember, [12]MAGONIA is the story of Aza Ray, a girl
     torn between the life she knows on earth and Magonia, the world she
     discovers in the sky.

     We are so in love with this cover! Does that anchor mean Aza is
     finally setting down roots?! But in which world, Earth or
     Magonia?!!! Ahhh we can’t wait to find out!

     Here’s more about the sequel!

     About the book:

     Where is home when you were born in the stars?

     Aza Ray is back on earth. Her boyfriend Jason is overjoyed. Her
     family is healed. She’s living a normal life, or as normal as it can
     be if you’ve spent the past year dying, waking up on a sky ship, and
     discovering that your song can change the world.

     As in, not normal.  Part of Aza still yearns for the clouds, no
     matter how much she loves the people on the ground.

     When Jason’s paranoia over Aza’s safety causes him to make a
     terrible mistake, Aza finds herself a fugitive in Magonia, tasked
     with opposing her radical, bloodthirsty, recently-escaped mother,
     Zal Quel, and her singing partner Dai. She must travel to the edge
     of the world in search of a legendary weapon, The Flock, in a
     journey through fire and identity that will transform her forever.

     In this stunning sequel to the critically acclaimed Magonia, one
     girl must make an impossible choice between two families, two
     homes—and two versions of herself.

     Aerie goes on sale October 4, 2016.

Rampion Kids Part Three

   Posted on [25]February 14, 2016 with 230 notes [26]via / [27]source

   [28]nothingtoseehere-move-along:

Kaider:

     * For Kai and Cinder, having kids was important to insure that the
       royal line continued, but to be honest, they were both terrified by
       the idea at first. Neither of them had any experience with
       children, but they figure if they survived a revolution they can
       probably survive children. Maybe. Hopefully.
     * Crown Princess Ember is the first to come along, about three years
       into their marriage.

     * Her name was Kai’s idea, as a nod to Cinder’s nonofficial name, and
       he stubbornly refused to pick a more traditional choice, so they
       went with it.
     * Given that her parents share many of the same traits, it’s hard to
       say exactly which side she inherited her sharp, intelligent brown
       eyes and tan skin from, but that wickedly sardonic half-smile is
       completely Cinder’s and the contagious laughter that spills out of
       her when her brother makes a sassy remark and her thick, black hair
       are unmistakeably Kai’s.
     * From the moment she’s old enough to understand that she’s going to
       inherit the crown someday, Ember is ecstatic about it. She’s going
       to get her daddy’s job! She’s going to get to help people and write
       pretty speeches and dance the first dance at the Peace Festival and
       she absolutely cannot wait.

     * She shadows both her parents while they work every chance she gets.
       She’s spent many a meeting sitting in her mom’s lap while Cinder
       works and many a speech balanced on her father’s hip while the
       cameras flash to catch the cutest photos ever.

     That dedication never goes away. She throws herself into her studies
   and even does extra work to insure that she’s the most knowledgeable
   person ever in politics and law(both national and international) and
   diplomacy and everything else that could possibly make her a better
   ruler for her people. It’s all she’s ever wanted to do and she intends
   to be awesome at it.

     Approximately two years later, Prince Rento comes along.
     * Rento is absolutely the spitting image of his father, from his
       lanky frame to his shaggy hair. He even copies some of his father’s
       mannerisms (which Cinder finds hilarious and which always reminds
       Torin of Kai and Rikkan).
     * That being said, there’s an awful lot of his mother in him, too. He
       doesn’t suffer fools well at all and has gotten more than a few
       lectures from Surrogate Grandpa Torin about not sassing the press
       when they say stupid things [DEL: though Cinder may or may not be
       giving him secret high fives whenever he pulls off a particularly
       great burn :DEL] .
     * Unlike his sister, Rento has no interest whatsoever in his royal
       responsibilities. In fact, he spends a lot of his time jokingly
       asking if maybe they can dissolve this monarchy like Mom dissolved
       hers.

     * Ember always throws her shoe(or whatever’s closest) at him when he
       does that.

     Rento would much rather spend his time working on his music. Like
   most young royals, he was given the requisite vocal and instrumental
   training, but unlike most, he fell head over heels in love with music.
     * He sings duets with Aunt Cress whenever the Rampion is in town.
     * He’s even released a song or two online under a false name and
       gained a bit of a following for them.

     New video, my loves! I really enjoyed ACOTAR when I read it a few
     months back (minus the slow as hell beginning because oh my
     goodness). But something kept bugging this part of my brain and
     since I don’t know what to do with it, I thought I’d make a video
     casually chatting about it. If you’re able and willing, watch and
     tell me what you think! Am I making a big deal out of nothing? Or
     did some of you guys feel it too? Thank you so much! 💕

     (I want to tag for triggers but I’m not familiar with the best way
     to do so. PLEASE ADVISE FOR SAFETY.)

   [65]andshewaits:

💜 It’s almost Valentine’s Day, friends! Time to celebrate my little Love
goddess with a [66]TOUCH giveaway!

     One winner will receive:
     * A signed paperback copy
     * [67]A set of illustrated bookmarks, of the deities’ arrows (Love,
       Anger, Envy, Sorrow, and Wonder)

     Guidelines:
     * You must be 18 years or older to enter, or have your parent’s

     * You do not need to be following me, but it would be very much
       appreciated.
     * Either reblog and/or like this post to enter. Multiple reblogs are
       okay.
     * Do NOT leave personal information in reblogs.
     * Giveaway is international.
     * No purchase necessary. Giveaway is void where prohibited.

     * The winner will be chosen randomly, and then they’ll have 48 hours
       to respond before a new winner is chosen.

     TOUCH:

     The myth of Eros isn’t the truth. Her story is the truth …
     Love is an immortal bad girl. With a strike of her arrow and a smirk
     on her face, she pins human hearts together against their will. It’s
     for their own good, of course—silly, clueless creatures that they
     are.
     But Love has never loved. Not until the Fates parcel her off to a
     small, frostbitten town littered with needy souls. Not until she
     crosses paths with Andrew, a boy whose gaze locks onto hers. Yet how
     can this be? Mortals don’t have the power to see deities.
     The longer they’re friends, the more Love wishes she could touch
     Andrew. In gentle ways. In other tempting and reckless ways as well.
     It’s impossible. She isn’t a true part of his world. She’s an
     outsider whose fingers will only ever sweep through him. A
     mischievous, invisible goddess who’s destined to be alone. And he’s
     destined for someone else. By order of the Fates, it’s Love’s duty
     to betray his trust. To seal his heart while ignoring the gash in
     her own.
     Or she could become human. For there is one very tricky, very
     dangerous way to do so.
     If only Andrew felt the same about her, it might be worth the risk.
     *Mature YA: sexual content and language. Intended for readers 17 and
     older*
