[7]Contempt Culture

   December 16, 2015

   So when I started programming in 2001, it was du jour in the
   communities I participated in to be highly critical of other languages.
   Other languages sucked, the people using them were losers or stupid, if
   they would just use a real language, such as the one we used,
   everything would just be better.

   Right?

   This sort of culturally-encoded language was really prevalent around
   condemning PHP and Java. Developers in these languages were actively
   referred to as less competent than developers in the other, more
   blessed languages.

   And at the time, as a new developer, I internalised this pretty
   heavily. The language I was in was blessed, obviously, not because I
   was using it but because it was better designed than a language like
   PHP, less wordy and annoying than Java, more flexible than many other
   options.

   It didn’t matter that it was (and remains) difficult to read, it was
   that we were better for using it.

   I repeated this pattern for a really long time, and as I learned new
   languages and patterns I’d repeat the same behaviour in those new
   environments. I was almost certainly not that fun to be around, a
   microcosm of the broader unpleasantness in tech.

   At least, until I got called on it.

“Have you thought about…”

   I’d been making critical comments about PHP the language, and PHP
   developers, nothing more than standard “PHP sucks” sort of language.
   The same thing I’d been doing, and supported in doing, for years.

   Getting called out was hard, and I was asked to consider who and what I
   was criticising. I was able to access a very specific version of the
   self-taught narrative, where I used “real” programming languages and
   had “real” passion and drive, the result of which was that I fit the
   early hacker archetypes and was permitted status - as long as I
   participated in gate keeping. My self-taught narrative is not other
   peoples’ self-taught narrative, and I was very firmly reminded of that.
   Other self-taught narratives, such as starting with Wordpress-based
   design backgrounds and moving from more simple themes to more complex
   themes where PHP knowledge is required, to plugin development is a
   completely valid narrative, but a path that is predominately for women.

   This was a bombshell. I’d been loudly criticising the language and,
   through that criticism, implying that people using the language weren’t
   as good me, weren’t good programmers. And suddenly I was thinking about
   all the myriad ways that someone with that background would feel
   othered by me, like they didn’t belong and weren’t welcome in the
   communities I was a part of.

   All of the ways in which I was actively participating in the exclusion
   of women from STEM.

Intent is Not Magic[8]1

   Of course, I hadn’t intended to do any of these things, but as I came
   to realise, it doesn’t matter what I intended to do, what matters is
   that I did it and that it had real repercussions.

   I intended to make fun of a language, the repercussion is that people
   from minority backgrounds wouldn’t want to talk to me about the things
   they’d done in that language, they wouldn’t feel safe talking about
   their achievements and exploits.

   And why would they feel safe? If they say what they use, we as a
   culture laugh at their choice. We tell them they should know better,
   tell them that it’s a horrible tool. Tell them that they are wrong. We
   ignore the achievement and focus exclusively on how it was reached, on
   how much better we are because we had access to narratives that the
   broader culture had already deemed more real.

   Not better narratives or better tools, just more accepted, more
   permitted, more discriminatory.

Contempt Currency

   I was taught to be contemptuous of the non-blessed narratives, and I
   was taught to pay for my continued access to the technical communities
   through perpetuating that contempt. I was taught to have an elevated
   sense of self-worth, driven by the elitism baked into the hacker ethos
   as I learned to program. By adopting the same patterns that other, more
   knowledgable people expressed I could feel more credible, more like a
   real part of the community, more like I belonged.

   I bought my sense of belonging, with contempt, and paid for it with
   contempt and exclusionary behaviour.

   And now, I realise how much of it is an anxiety response. What if I
   chose the wrong thing? What if other people judge me for my choices and
   assert that my hard-earned skills actually aren’t worth anything?

   What if people find out I’m a fraud?

   By perpetuating a culture of contempt as the means of acquiring
   credibility, I was able to avoid these difficult, introspective
   questions. We don’t have to look at how we’re harming other people who
   want in, don’t have to acknowledge the niggling little voice in the
   back of our head asking are you good enough. It wasn’t me that was
   wrong, it was them.

   Instead, I was taught to use emotional weaponry to silence and exclude
   others, resulting in the remaining voices being the most toxic and
   exclusionary, the most able to tolerate toxicity and exclusionary
   attitudes.

   This pattern is common in tech, from extremely high-profile projects
   like the Linux kernel to the ongoing os/language/editor “wars” to the
   vile reactionary attitudes towards the introduction of Codes of
   Conduct, to any developers making disparaging comments about other
   peoples’ ability to code, and the growing contempt around people whose
   first or primary language is JavaScript.

And now

   This culture has ramifications. PHP communities, for example, have
   lacked access to the development of DevOps tooling, the use of PHP is
   widely derided as being insecure by default, are they are widely mocked
   for being an “objectively bad language.”

   Yet people make their livings working with PHP, deploying PHP, trying
   to secure PHP. Don’t they deserve the help that we received, the help
   of good practises and security-first development? These people who
   can’t improve their work because we won’t work with them and drive them
   away from our communities with mockery and spite.

   And then they engineer things on their own, because they still need
   these tools, and we have the gall to ask why they didn’t use these
   other tools.

   Tools that we mocked them for asking about, telling them to get a real
   language, to rewrite their entire app, to rebuild from scratch because
   their particular path was not blessed enough.

   Because we were the problematic elements.

I’m Tired of This

   It’s 2015, and I saw a presenter at a Python conference make fun of
   Java. How would that feel to people trying to move from Java into
   something else? I wouldn’t feel welcome, and I’d have learned that the
   idea that the Python community is welcoming wasn’t true.

   I’m tired of calling people out again and again for dumping on PHP.

   I’m tired of people dumping on Windows, that most popular operating
   system, because it’s not what we choose to use, tired of the fact that
   we don’t make it easy to use our tools and teach them how to move, when
   they’re ready.

   Instead, we lecture and dismiss and heap scorn upon them. We don’t
   reinforce our communities with respect or a sense of achievement, but
   with shame and contempt and awfulness. We exclude people.

   I’ve excluded people. Directly, me. I have to own up to that and deal
   with it.

   We excluded people. Directly. All of us. Even if we didn’t intend to,
   it does not matter. We make fun of the things others care about, make
   them feel small, make them feel like their achievements didn’t matter.
   Make them feel like they’re not welcome.

What can we Do?

   SHUT. UP.

   No, really, cut it out. If you need to make fun of a language, do it
   with your own language, inside your own community. JavaScript is really
   good at this, because they’re trying to help people write better code
   within JavaScript.

   Do it around friends only, and acknowledge that it’s extremely
   problematic that you’re doing it at all.

   Find some amazing project to celebrate in a language you’re
   contemptuous of.

   Go to meetups of what you despise. Say you don’t know anything, and see
   how welcoming they are to new people. See what they say, what they do,
   and ask if you’d be as welcoming to them when they come to your
   meetups.

   Work to change your community. Ask people who try to pay for their
   membership in contempt to stop, or to leave. Make it unacceptable to
   use these behaviours as a means of obtaining social wealth.

   The best advice we give programmers is to leave things better than how
   they started. We do it with code, why don’t we do it with communities?
   Why don’t we do it with people, colleagues, friends?

   Ask why it’s okay to do these things in your community, and leave
   things better than when you started.

[18]Destiny

   November 23, 2015

   So.

   Destiny.

   [19]Destiny.

   I’ve been playing Destiny since July 2015 and I started with just the
   base game. I didn’t know what to expect. An FPS obviously, but I’d
   ignored all of the hype and trailers and reviews and basically
   everything that was said about Destiny. Not because I didn’t want to be
   spoiled, but since I wasn’t hugely into Halo I wasn’t terribly
   intrigued by a new property from Bungie. I’d heard vague noises that it
   was an MMO and that it was extremely pretty, but that was quite
   literally all I knew.

   It’s now late November 2015, and I’m up to two raid-capable toons and a
   bit of a collection of Year 2 exotic weapons.

   You could say I’m hooked.

So what is Destiny?

   The best way of describing Destiny is that it’s an MMO+FPS-lite. Almost
   all of the story content is single-player, with occasional bits of
   collaborative content, like shared missions called “Strikes” where a
   group of players take on a harder boss.

   I find this a really nice structure for the majority of the PvE
   content. I don’t have to organise groups or try to build a community, I
   can just sit down and push a button and sometimes need to be matched
   with some random people and just enjoy content.

   In the main worlds interaction with other people is extremely limited,
   which is really nice. Occasionally you might bump into some people and
   tackle a timed boss or mini-event, but most of the time it’s just you
   and the big open worlds. This ends up surprisingly pleasant, as the
   amount of griefing seems to be quite minimal. I can’t interact with
   others, I just run through them. I can have my kills stolen, but only
   until I leave the area and move to another shard.

Story

   The story in the PvE parts of Destiny is… well, the first year’s
   content was atrocious. Badly written, poorly exposited rubbish that
   barely scratched the surface of what could have been an impressive and
   interesting world, but completely missed the mark.

   Missed the mark so badly that [20]Kotaku wrote an [21]extremely
   in-depth article on why it was so badly screwed up.

   TL;DR: they fired their writers and “rewrote” the story with only a
   couple of months before launch.

   The story was rubbish to the point of being endlessly, actively mocked
   on the internet. Lines such as “I don’t have time to explain why I
   don’t have time to explain” and “Be careful! Its power is dark!”

   Given it’s Bungie, it ought to have been so very much better.

   With the first of the Year 2 content, “The Taken King”, it appears they
   hired (or re-hired) competent writers. There’s considerably more
   interaction between characters and considerably more exposition and
   content that illuminates and expands the world. The writing isn’t on
   the stellar levels of Mass Effect, but compared to Year 1 it’s a
   pinnacle of literary achievement.

MMO

   Once you’ve exhausted the story missions there’s the grind, and Destiny
   is quite grindy. Finding a bunch of materials to resolve quests, across
   several days. Having to collect currency, which can only be done over
   several days. Collecting better gear, which can only be done by
   repeatedly and continually playing the same parts of the game and doing
   the same things over and over.

   The post-game content is starting to do the Actual MMO parts, the raids
   and weekly strike missions. These are high-level content and require
   actively working to find groups of people to play with. This is as
   predictably hit-or-miss as any collection of people will end up being.
   Racism and homophobia abounds, angry people and shitty environments.

   But also really great people who are kind, form groups that work
   together really well and work to help people approach content they’ve
   never approached before.

   Variable.

   It’s most sensible to find a regular group to play with, a clan in the
   Destiny parlance.

PVP

   The PvP gaming is as much fun as PvP gaming ever is; a lot of fun if
   you’re great, stressful and miserable if you’re merely good. There
   appears to be a binning function in the matchmaking functionality,
   which tries to pair you against players of a similar skill. This would
   probably be great… if you weren’t on the edge of a bin, as I seem to
   be. My games tend to follow the pattern of being completely outmatched
   for several games, get matched down a bin, do really well, get matched
   up a bin, rinse, repeat.

   This makes for intensely frustrating gaming. As soon as I start to feel
   competent and capable and like I’m having fun, Destiny reminds me that
   I’m actually immensely terrible and that misery should be my only
   reward.

So Would I recommend it?

   No. Mostly.

   The no part comes in because of how fundamentally awful the base story
   is.

   Getting to the good part of the game, The Taken King, can happen almost
   immediately, and all the Y1 DLC can largely be ignored, but the result
   will be that your character will be frightfully underskilled and
   require considerable grinding to level up the skills and abilities,
   abilities that are critical to any sort of non-miserable PvP play.

   Playing the Y1 content can help with that, but it’s a miserable slog of
   poor writing.

   PvP is a crapshoot. End content is only as good as your friends.

   It’s super grindy.

   On the mostly side, I really enjoy playing Destiny. The FPS mechanics
   are well-tuned and very satisfying, and it’s a lot of fun mastering
   techniques for the raid and getting content that took several days to
   complete the first time down to an hour and a half of gaming.

   The Year 2 story is markedly better, on the border of “good”. The lore
   of why things have happened is fleshed out, and we begin to see
   motivations and forces beyond “here’s some mooks, shoot them,” and
   that’s extremely appealing. There’s hooks for the next DLC content that
   have me extremely excited. There’s a there there now, a place that
   feels larger than myself and a world that feels like I want to explore
   it further.

   But on the whole, it’s such an investment of time and energy for such
   terrible writing that I just can’t recommend it.

[26]So I Started a Business

   November 18, 2015

   So as you noticed, I’ve not really been blogging very much since March,
   and there’s a really good reason for it.

   And that reason is I started a company, [27]Eiara Devops. I’ve been
   running for the last 7 months, since the beginning of April, and it’s
   been a huge amount of fun and stress, but as all small businesses do it
   expanded to occupy all the time in the world.

   Time that I would be blogging in, for instance, got overwhelmed with
   the intensity that is starting and trying to grow a business. Heady
   stuff!

   With recently recovering my blog and moving fully to [28]blot.im, I
   feel like I’ve refined the process enough to have space in which my
   thoughts can once again be a part of the greater internet discussion.

   Thanks for your patience!

[31]A New Place

   November 17, 2015

   Hello, and welcome to The Particular Finest 2.0.

   You may have noticed that we had an outage for a while! I discovered,
   much to my chagrin and annoyance, that my previous host [32]Scriptogram
   had shut down without much of a notification that they were doing so.

   I’d always it was a matter of time. Scriptogram didn’t charge any money
   for the service, and running services costs money to keep the servers
   up and the bandwidth flowing. But it’s always easier to do nothing than
   to migrate when there’s no pressing need, and even though other
   Dropbox-backed blogging engines existed before Scriptogram failed I
   didn’t feel an urgent pressure to move.

   The content you’re now reading is on [33]blot.im, a paid service for
   doing the Dropbox-backed static blog.

   My nice theme is being migrated over, so you’ll be seeing that soon.
   I’m also in a bit of a better place and have a few more spoons to
   start, you know, actually blogging again.

   Welcome back!

[35]100% Schmundred percent

   May 23, 2015

   I spoke about [36]Ori the other day, and I still stand by all those
   words. It’s beautiful and wonderful and magical in all sorts of good
   ways.

   It’s also deeply, immensely frustrating. Let’s talk a bit about why.

   In most Metroidvania games the primary focusses are exploration and
   combat. You explore the space to find upgrades to help you explore
   further and shoot the things you find there.

   Ori chooses a different pair of primary focusses, using exploration and
   movement instead. Combat is present in the same way that platforming is
   present in Metroid, a perfunctory nod to a system that’s intended to
   give variety to the major focusses.

   The movement upgrades in Super Metroid serve the exploration and the
   combat, with the screw attack and speed boost providing new ways of
   engaging in combat, the others providing new ways to reach enemies to
   shoot. This is present even in the first two upgrades, the Morph Ball
   and Bomb, powers to help you reach new enemies, and then blow them up.

   In Ori, all the upgrades focus on movement, and only movement. This
   different focus has a remarkably interesting side-effect:

   There are no boss fights.

Run, run, run, run away

   In Ori, the player never engages in combat with the primary antagonist,
   and only in one scene do we even injure the antagonist directly. But,
   we still have major challenges that we face, challenges that are
   analogous to the missing boss fights.

   In Ori we are expected to repair three major Temple constructs, each of
   which has world-changing repurcussions when completed, and would
   normally have a boss battle at the end.

   Ori challenges that normality by making platforming itself the boss
   fight, placing the player in a challenging and stressful environment
   and requiring them to escape using the movement tools unlocked so far.
   I thought this was a great idea, as Ori isn’t a combat-oriented
   character and the game isn’t about combat. A boss battle would have
   violated the theme and the style of the game and the world and broken
   our expectations on how things worked.

Again, from the top

   Unfortunately, these were the sequences in Ori that I found the most
   grindingly frustrating.

   Throughout the game, the player is expected to manage their
   checkpoints, and the game is usually good about allowing checkpoints to
   be spawned pretty much anywhere. This permission to checkpoint at whim
   drives a considerable amount of the challenge in the platforming, as
   once you’re through a difficult patch you can checkpoint, and relax.
   It’s a powerful reward.

   It’s also an action you can’t take, at all, during the escape
   sequences.

   The escape sequences in Ori are difficult, requiring considerable
   precision and timing to succeed at. This would be fine, but what you
   are escaping from is a mechanic that will instantly kill you. Every
   time.

   Over and over and over and over until you get it just perfectly right.

   Each new subsection of the escape will be filled with new hazards, that
   will kill you, pushing you back to the beginning of the whole sequence.
   What should be a challenging, stressful but ultimately satisfying
   sequence turns into a frustrating grind of making it far enough to
   discover the next thing that will kill you, dodging that, and repeating
   until you’ve reached the end.

   This leaves that final run where the sequence is completed, what ought
   to be the glorious culmination of skill and precision to overcome
   incredible odds as merely the last episode of seething frustration. I
   didn’t feel glorious or rewarded or like I had mastered the mechanics
   when I completed these sections, I felt finally I am done that fucking
   awful bit.

   This isn’t a good feeling.

Replay

   While I was playing, I really lovedOri. It was the Metroidvania game
   I’ve wanted to have since I played Shadow Complex and Insanely Twisted
   Shadow Planet. I loved the amazing graphics, I loved that all the
   characters were female.

   Having completed the game, do I want to replay it?

   No. Categorically no.

   Unlike Metroid, where I want to revisit and discover and explore more,
   the Forest of Ori remains more frustration than enjoyment, more endured
   than pleasant. I remain glad I played it, but it’s become considerably
   harder to recommend to anyone but those who truly love the Metroidvania
   style or are looking for precision platforming gaming.

[41](Almost) Actually Better Cameras

   March 24, 2015

   Say, who remembers when I wrote about the [42]Sony QX100
   NFC-wireless-camera accessory thing? It was a cool piece of tech, but
   pretty limited, as first generations often are.

   I remarked at the time that it would be an amazing piece of HERE IS MY
   MONEY PLEASE TAKE IT tech if, instead of it being a point-and-shoot
   system, it offered a real sensor and an interchangable lens mount.

   Someone was listening! Sony has released almost what I asked for, and
   it’s called the (again, unimaginatively named) [43]ILCE-QX1. In all
   seriousness, whoever is naming these things needs to stop. This is
   terrible.

   I haven’t bought one of these, but I do want to talk about what it is
   versus what it ought to be.

The Good!

   This is really amazing: Sony has taken an [44]APS-C sensor and jammed
   it into a tiny cylinder, divorced from much of the legacy that is
   “camera bodies.” I can replace the lens! I can get really awesome
   lenses and put them on! I can share the really good photos I take
   immediately, closing the irritatingly arduous loop of take, go home,
   upload.

   DSLR-quality Instagram, anyone?

The Everything Else!

   Of course, there’s always bad parts. It’s the rule number one of
   shipping technology.

   For starters, Sony didn’t improve on the connection process from the
   QX100. In order to use your phone with the camera, you have to do the
   NFC dance, adding a considerable delay from want to shoot to shooting.
   And that’s just on Android! The entire process is considerably worse on
   iOS, requiring pairing your phone with the camera over WiFi.

   On both Android and iOS, you’re required to use the terrible[45]1
   “PlayMemories Mobile” app instead of the native camera, rendering any
   advances the phone makes in Time To Shooting as moot.

   Now, this isn’t entirely Sony’s fault. Apple keeps these sorts of
   things quite tightly locked down, and Android was almost certainly
   never designed with the idea of a custom Bluetooth lens contraption
   replacing the native camera.

   However.

   There’s this interesting other fact in play, which is that Sony also
   makes a smartphone. [46]A range of them, in fact, that you may have
   heard of!

   I even use one!

   So what, you might reply, and justly so. Well, it seems to me that Sony
   offers this terribly-named, extremely interesting tech gadget with
   abysmal user experience on most smartphones, and Sony also offers their
   own smartphone where they maintain full control of the operating
   system.

   But they don’t ship a separate app or any integration for users on
   their own platform to have a better experience. An Xperia owner is
   forced to use the same terrible app as the Galaxy S owner or the Moto G
   owner. Everyone endures the same terrible experience.

   But an Xperia owner shouldn’t have to. An Xperia owner could have a
   device upon which the native camera is overridden by the Sony-branded
   external camera modules, could have a device where Time To Shoot is
   considerably faster and more intuitive, enabled by Sony owning their
   own underlying platform.

The Funnel

   Overall, this device which looks so good but isn’t is quite obviously
   not meant for established photographers. It’s worse than a standalone
   camera in most ways and lacks the platform integration that would
   really make it exceptional. For a photographer, it’d be a shallow
   bauble.

   I don’t think it’s aiming at existing photographers, but rather at
   people wanting considerably better photos with the cellphone they have,
   a camera that can be upgraded indepentently of their phone, and
   vice-versa.

   Which this is, in spades.

   On Sony’s side, this is an excellent mechanism to capture photographers
   moving into systems with replaceable lenses, as the QX1 uses their
   proprietary E-mount format. As good glass is one of the most expensive
   and least likely to be upgraded aspects of a photographers’ arsenal,
   Sony provides a clean upgrade path for a photographer to move into
   dedicated camera bodies without losing their investment.

   Their use of industry-standard MicroSD cards also makes it more likely
   to get uptake in camera shops, enabling re-use of existing hardware
   that a customer may have.

   As a photographer with dedicated bodies and an existing investment in
   lenses, the QX1 isn’t for me. It’s close, and as phones become more
   powerful and vendors aim for interesting points of differentiation it
   will get closer.

   Hopefully it won’t be long before we see a “camera” body has been
   designed to work with a phone, a phone that has been designed to work
   with that camera body, while using micro 4/3rds. A device good enough
   that a dedicated body is no longer necessary, a device that is,
   effectively, just carrying the lens by itself.

   The QX1 isn’t.

   Soon, though. Soon.

[53]Twitter

   March 17, 2015

   Hi, Twitter.

   It’s time we had a bit of a talk.

   We met in 2007. It was a heavy time for me, full of self-discovery and
   emotions and difficulties and, well, the general ephemera of life
   itself. You were so young, but then, so was I.

   With you I felt so free, I felt so able to share and be myself, to not
   be afraid of anything. I could be anything or anyone with you, and you
   showed us all how the world could change. You were there when I needed
   friends, Twitter, gave me tweetups and connections spanning the globe.
   You were there when I publicly came out as trans. You’ve been there
   through hardness and joy, helped with my depression and shared in my
   victories.

   I wouldn’t trade any of that for the world.

   But.

   But, but, but.

   It’s been a long time since I’ve felt safe with you, Twitter, a long
   time since I had that freedom. I’m afraid all the time, afraid that if
   I say the wrong thing that you’ll fly into a rage. Instead of seeing
   you treat my friends well, I see you hurt people and revel in it. I
   watch you ignore their pain and the harm that you’re doing.

   But then, when I was so depressed for so long and I reached out to you
   for help, sometimes you were really there and you really cared, and
   that was really great.

   Sometimes. Sometimes you weren’t there and I would still be talking to
   you and hoping that my friends would overhear, instead of just talking
   to my friends. I let you maintain my social network, and didn’t notice
   as you changed how I interact.

   It hurt when I noticed that I was doing that, how I felt like I’d
   forgotten how to be a good friend, that I needed to re-learn how to
   connect.

   The more I’ve grown to depend on you, the more you’ve drawn away.
   Sometimes you make me feel like I don’t matter and that what we had
   before doesn’t exist.

   Maybe it never did.

   The hardest part, Twitter, is seeing how abusive you’ve become.

   Maybe you always were, and it just took me this long to notice. We have
   so much history together, history I don’t want to lose, and maybe that
   blinded me.

   We’ve tried separation before, and I’ve always come crawling back. I’ve
   never said how smug I think you feel when I do, how you enjoy my
   dependency. You want me here, you love that I want it. I’ve never said
   how dirty I feel, when I do come back.

   But I do come back. You’ve become a part of me, changed who I am and
   who I can become. I’ll keep coming back, and it’s time to accept that.

   Instead of a teary departure, my dear Twitter, how we’re together is
   going to change. The way you’re so ephemeral has changed how I speak,
   but not for the better. I’m still going to rely on you, but I don’t
   want you to be the first to hear my thoughts.

   Instead, I’m going to speak to myself first, and let you know I’ve said
   something.

   Instead, I’m going to talk to my friends on my own, not speak to the
   wind and hope they hear.

   Instead, Twitter, as we walk together, I’m going to lead.

[57]Ori and the Blind Forest

   March 16, 2015

   [58]Ori and the Blind Forest came out last week, and I was very, very
   excited that it did.

   I’d first seen a trailer for Ori, oh, sometime in 2014. It looked
   incredible, sad humming music over amazing artwork of a giant black
   creature and its small, white companion.

   Obviously it immediately went on my wishlist, and I didn’t even know
   what kind of game it was.

   Fast-forward to last week, and its release. It’s out! I said, and leapt
   to Steam to purchase my copy, and start the download. It’s out! What
   did I buy? It turns out, I hadn’t read anything about the game and had
   no idea if it was even good. I was excited for the beauty of it, for
   the smoothness of the world and the delight of the music, and it was
   worth it for that alone.

   Oh, but the game, what did I buy? Well, let me talk about that.

   Ori is a side-scroller. It’s a platformer. It’s Metroidvania, my most
   beloved of all genres. It is gloriously pretty, what appears to be
   hand-drawn and animated to silky smooth perfection, and Ori’s movement
   is fluid and responsive and breathtaking to behold.

   It’s amazingly pretty. Did I say that already?

   I am loving this game. Except for the tree, all the major characters
   are referred to with female pronouns. Ori is a she, the angry owl is,
   Naru. Everyone has been she so far. I can’t describe how wonderful it
   is to just have “she did this” or “she did that” as the standard
   narration.

   It’s such a wonderful change from the Male As Endless Default that
   we’re subjected to.

But…

   This game isn’t for everyone. You have to enjoy the Metroidvania style
   of considerable backtracking and exploration, working through areas
   where you’ve already been. Repeatedly. If you like your levels to be
   new and distinct, this perhaps isn’t for you.

   The other thing about Ori is that its platforming is really hard.
   There’s a sequence about a third of the way in where you have to use a
   newly unlocked movement ability while being chased by insta-death. And
   this way goes a long way, and it’s hard. As a sequence it’s about 2
   minutes long but it took me over an hour to clear, solely because of
   the perfection required.

   As a result, I’d describe Ori as a love-letter to platformers and old,
   2D Metroid games. It’s intentionally challenging and frustrating,
   asking a great deal of the player in terms of dexerity and precision,
   rewarding excellent play with a heady rush of, wow, I just outran THAT.

   And I barely touched the ground.

Buy it.

   It’s pretty. The music is lovely. It stars female creatures. It does so
   many things right and it makes me so happy, even when it makes me want
   to throw the controller because I can’t quite get the precision right.

   If this sounds like your thing, I wholly recommend Ori.

   If it’s not your thing, I don’t recommend it because it will be a
   wholly frustrating experience.

[62]Why Can't We Have Nice Things

   March 11, 2015

   A few months ago there was an announcement about a new Ghostbusters
   movie. This is interesting, Ghostbusters was a fun movie back in the
   day and it’d be neat to see a modern take on it. Great.

   Even cooler was the fact that the Ghostbusters team was going to be
   entirely composed of women. Excellent! The lack of gender diversity is
   hugely glaring, and the growing awareness of how awful things are is
   resulting in positive steps like this.

   I’m happy, but of course there’s a never-endingly whiny contingent of
   entitled men proclaiming that ACTUALLY THIS IS THE REAL SEXISM. I’m not
   going to link to any of it because, really, who wants to read that kind
   of dreck?

   But I’m happy with Ghostbusters, and life carries on.

   Until the other day, [63]when Sony decides to announce that they’re
   booting Another Ghostbusters Movie.

   And I’m just

   no.

   Go read that article, it’s a great summation of why this is hugely
   problematic.

   Or, as someone on Metafilter (paraphrased) said: “Instead of having The
   Ghostbusters, which happened to star women, now we have Ghostbusters
   and Lady Ghostbusters.”

[67]What does this Solve?

   March 10, 2015

   So it’s a big tech show-annouce-press-everything-thing right now. Just
   past? CES maybe? MWC? I don’t actually know. Stuff’s going on, things
   have been announced, some of them look shiny.

   Some of those things don’t look shiny.

   One of the not shiny-things that big company extraordinare Sony
   announced is their Google Glass-alike augmented reality glasses thing.
   It’s $840 US dollars. You can [68]look at a video about it and
   everything, and really, this can only be seen to be believed. Giant,
   bulky frames complemented by a giant, bulky hockey puck prominently
   clipped to your jacket.

   In spite of that, I’d still wear and use them if they were any good.
   Augmented reality is cool, it’s the future, it’s things that I want to
   see come about in real life. I want my heads-up goggles that integrate
   the Internet, providing useful passive information about the real
   spaces that I’m in.

   What I don’t want is to have notifications popping up before my eyes,
   because there’s no integration of the virtual with the physical. I
   don’t want to try to reply to a text message with dodgy voice detection
   or terrible in-my-glasses UI.

   Directions being overlaid on the world would be useful, but Google
   Glass got there years ago.

What Would Be Cool

   If you watch the video, the puck-glasses have to be paired with your
   phone, so they’re obviously being treated as an extension of the phone.
   Why not take advantage of that?

   Say, when the user looks at their phone their glasses could detect and
   turn the phone on, or maybe draw a simple UI over of the phone with the
   current notifications. A phone placed on a flat surface and turned on,
   could be used to project a larger display across that surface.

   Imagine, placing your phone on a surface and the phone becomes the
   surface, but just for you! Adding a second camera for binocular vision
   and you could easily provide Kinect-style depth mapping, letting the
   user drag elements around or type on a virtual keyboard. This would be
   the promise of the Ubuntu Edge without the necessity of a full HDMI
   monitor, keyboard and mouse to dock with. Any surface could become a
   simple, usable computer system.

   If the company wasn’t privacy-invadingly malicious or in a malicious
   legal environment, another useful overlay would be letting users have a
   pop-up beside their head with a small blurb about who they are. Add a
   name! Or don’t! By having the device itself advertise who is the owner,
   we avoid the considerable unpleasantness around early versions of such
   technologies requiring constantly-active facial recognition technology.

What Isn’t Cool

   This device is a Pebble, only strapped to your face. It doesn’t bring
   anything new or interesting to what we already have, and doesn’t make
   use of any of the powers that augmented reality or the powerful pocket
   computers can provide.

   Ugliness can be forgiven for magical, and from the video Sony’s glasses
   aren’t magical. There’s no there there, just a scrolling banner of text
   remaining divorced from the contextual world.
