Actor Resume Template

   Being an actor is one of the most exciting and thrilling occupations in
   the world. It is also one of the most competitive. Regardless of
   whether you are just starting out in this occupation or whether you are
   already have some experience, writing a good actor resume is a must.

   An actor resume template can help you to get started in writing an
   attention grabbing resume. One thing that you need to keep in mind when
   using an actor resume template is that actor resumes do tend to be
   somewhat different from traditional resumes. For example, information
   that you would never include on a traditional resume will often be
   included on an actor resume template. Such information may include
   height and weight as well as eye color and hair color. The reason such
   information is included on an actor resume template is that it could be
   critical to a particular role.

   As is the case with any other resume, an actor resume template will
   also requite you to list information about your past experience.
   Listing your work experience in a chronological fashion is a good way
   to list all of your performances.

   In addition to your work experience, an actor resume template will also
   require that you list any special accomplishments or awards that you
   have won. Listing such accomplishments and awards can make a big
   difference in helping you to land a role that you want.

   One of the best ways to present your work experience and your
   accomplishments on your resume is with bullet points. This helps to
   draw the reader's eye to the most critical elements of your resume and
   really helps your resume to stand out.

   Of course, training and education are important elements of any resume
   as well and that is no different when writing an actor's resume. You
   should include any special training that you have had to help you with
   your acting career. This is particularly true for specialized forms of
   training, such as acting lessons or training.

   For the most part, you will want to make sure that you keep your resume
   to one page. If you find that you have more experience than that then
   you should consider leaving off older roles or minor performances in
   order to make sure that you have sufficient room on a one page resume
   for listing all of the most important information as it relates to your
   career.
