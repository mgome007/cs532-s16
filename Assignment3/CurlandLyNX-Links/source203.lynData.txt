   What an amazing day! 22 excited Digital Leaders with their parents and

   What an amazing day! 22 excited Digital Leaders with their parents and
   carers travelled to London for the day to take part in a presentation
   at the ExCel Centre.  Lots of people had to get up early to catch the
   train or start their car journey.  Everyone made sure they had some
   lunch before the show started at 12.45pm!  We were all a bit nervous
   but soon got over it as the audience were very nice and clapped and
   cheered us :)  Some Digital Leaders spoke on stage, others took
   photographs, some programmed Beebots and others used our new Spheros
   and Ollies. Our presentation didn’t seem to last long and soon it was
   the turn of the Digital Leaders from [51]Myrtle Park Primary School,
   [52]King Edward VI School and [53]Lady Lumley’s School. Everyone did an
   amazing job and should be very proud of themselves. When everyone had
   finished their presentation, we took questions from the audience – some
   were a bit tricky to answer!

   After the presentation the TTS stand spoke to us, saying what a great
   job we had done with the beebots and that they would like to visit us
   and bring us some new bluebots to test out – we can’t wait!  Lots of
   people have also contacted us about starting Digital Leaders and their
   own radio station, so we are looking forward to keeping in contact with
   them.

   Some of the Digital Leaders stayed at BETT for the rest of the day
   looking around all the stands and playing with the toys and equipment
   whilst others nipped off in to London to have a look around and visit
   museums.

   Everyone agreed that it was a totally brilliant day and one that they
   wouldn’t forget in a long time.  If you want to hear more about it, why
   not tune in to our [54]Rec Road Radio station on Friday at 2.30pm or
   listen to our podcast.

   them for us to use in our [68]BETT Show presentation on January 22nd at
   the Excel Centre in London.  They were a little tricky to manoeuvre to
   start with but once everyone got the hang of it, they went where they
   should!  Everyone is looking forward to taking them to BETT and showing
   the audience what they can do.

   It’s been a busy couple of weeks with the new Rec Road Radio station
   taking up lots of our time – but it is well worth it :) If you haven’t
   tuned in yet, go and have a listen to our podcasts [85]now :)

   We are very excited to announce that we have been asked to be part of a
   Digital Leader presentation at [86]BETT 2016 at the ExCel Centre in
   London on 22nd January!  We are all really excited about it and can’t
   wait to go.  We are going to be talking about how we use technology in
   school and how we share what we know with other pupils and teachers.
   We are hoping to demonstrate how we use Beebots and other programmable
   toys – so thought we would like to have another play ourselves. Could
   we write and programme an algorithm with more than 10 commands and not
   make a mistake? It was tricky but we did it :)

   Following the successful launch of Rec Road Radio last week, the
   Digital Leaders have been busy sorting! We asked everyone what they
   would like our radio show to contain and we spent the afternoon sorting
   it out into groups. We were really surprised with some requests and
   can’t wait to have more competitions! Our show this Friday is going to
   be a surprise request show, so we also sorted out all the music
   requests – one song was certainly very popular :) You will have to tune
   in to find out what it was.

   Everyone sat in their classrooms eagerly awaiting the very first
   broadcast of Rec Road Radio and I hope nobody was disappointed!  We had
   recorded an interview with Ingrid who visited us for the first time
   with Coco our guide dog – we all thought she was gorgeous! Some
   children from Year 1 read out the fireworks poems they had written and
   children and Digital Leaders from Year 2 wrote and read the weather
   forecast and this week’s horoscope.  In a very exciting finale, Alice
   was announced as the Rec Road Radio logo competition winner and came
   down to the studio to receive her prize. Her logo will feature on this
   our school websites soon.  If you missed the broadcast there is no need
   to feel sad as all the shows are recorded and can be listened to as
   podcasts [116]here.  Don’t forget to come back next Friday at 2.30pm
   for the request show.

   This week we have been creating posters for our latest (and at the
   moment TOP SECRET) venture – Rec Road Radio!!!  After half term we will
   be launching our own school radio station in assembly with a
   competition to design the Rec Road Radio logo – it’s all very exciting
   and we can’t wait to be broadcasting live to the world :)

   “This is so exciting – will people all over the world be able to hear
   us?” YES!!!
