[13]Advice For A Successful Web Design Strategy

   [14]October 30, 2015 by [15]3HdyLMN

   Web design is the ideal way to promote your website. A degree is not
   required to create useful websites, but you need proper information so
   that you know what to use and what to avoid. Continue reading and your
   web design knowledge will grow.

   When you are designing a website, it is important to have proper
   spelling and grammar. In addition to running spell-check on your
   content, ask a friend or co-worker to proofread everything. Having good
   spelling and grammar on your website will help give it a professional
   feel and your visitor will be more likely to return.

   Make sure your site passes the NoScript test. Activate this extension
   to assure that your sits is readable. There will be content that needs
   scripting like order systems. However, if the site is blank when the
   scripts are off, you have a problem.

   Don’t use splash pages for your site unless required by law, and
   especially don’t use a Flash intro. Most people just want to get to
   your content as quickly as possible, and don’t care to look at useless
   splash pages. If you have some amusing content that you absolutely want
   visitors to see, integrate it into the homepage instead.

   A successful website needs to work for visitors using any browser, so
   it is important to test your web pages to make sure they display
   properly in different browsers. Even though your website may display
   perfectly on Internet Explorer, this doesn’t mean that it will look the
   same on Chrome, Safari, or Firefox. Monitor how the pages look in major
   browsers before taking your website live.

   Set up your site so that visitors can cancel actions they initiate if
   they change their minds. For example, put a “clear” button on a form,
   an unsubscribe link on all newsletters and a “cancel” button on orders.
   Not allowing customers to cancel actions that they do not want to
   follow through with is unfair, and it is forceful, which may prevent
   those visitors from returning to your site or making purchases from you
   in the future.

   To help you attract a more professional crowd to your site, make sure
   you design your site with no spelling errors. When designing the site,
   utilize a spell checker and if need to, a grammar checker. If you have
   a site with poor spelling and grammar, people will not want to do
   business with you because they will think it is unprofessional.

   To help your website visitors easily navigate through your site, design
   it so that it becomes easy to find “stuff.” When you have a simple site
   that makes it easy to locate information, you keep your visitors there
   much longer. If you make it difficult for them, then they will get
   frustrated and leave.

   If you want more visitors to your site, you need to design it in a way
   that makes it easy to update content. If your site can be easily
   updated it helps you to be able to quickly add new and relevant
   information. A site that is constantly updated will keep your visitors
   coming back for more.

   Organize your links and avoid putting too many links in one area of
   your site. Doing this can confuse visitors and make them leave your
   site. If you do have many low- to mid-importance links, emulate the
   “blogrolls” seen in many blogs and tuck them away in a column on the
   right side of the page.

   To help make sure your website works as you are designing it, test it
   one of the browsers like Internet Explorer. When you test the website
   as you go along building it, you can quickly correct any problems that
   might show up once you live. When your website goes live you want your
   visitors to be able to see everything working correctly.

   Figure out your site’s target audience and ask them what they’re
   interested in with a website. This provides you better focus with site
   design and a better understanding of what features to include. Getting
   input about your readers’ interests is essential to a useful site.

   Site maps are an excellent piece of technology that allow users and
   search engines to get a better view of your site’s functions and
   layouts without extra work. Include a link to your sitemap from the
   homepage and leave it as simple as possible. The sitemap doesn’t need
   fancy graphics or fonts, just layout your website and update it when
   needed.

   Controls for the user’s interface are important, but don’t design them
   so that they are visually appealing, yet misleading towards their
   actual function. Make certain that each clickable option is clearly
   understandable from the text or image it presents. If the option is not
   yet implemented properly, don’t allow it to be seen by average viewers.

   Avoid every instance of spammy “sell language” that you possibly can.
   Studies show that users are likely to jump off of a webpage the instant
   they pick up the “salesman” vibe. This is because it is said to
   actually trigger a predatory response in human brain function! So next
   time you want to sell a product, remember that the potential consumer
   may view you as a predator and run!

   Make your design different than that of other sites in your niche.
   Visit the competition and compare it to your site. Having a similar
   website won’t make you stand out in the crowd. You’ll be the Brand X
   generic version of the site that was up before yours was.

   Create webpages that are “scannable”. Reading online is different than
   reading a newspaper or a book. By default, site visitors scan webpages,
   looking for anything that stands out. Make sure your pages have lists,
   bolded words, titles, and short blocks of text. That way, your site
   will “feel better” to site visitors, enticing them to stay on your
   site.

   The advice given to you in the above article is a great start to help
   you build a good website, especially when you follow the information
   that you just learned. You will eventually see how good your websites
   look when you have great advice to follow. Create some great sites

[17]How You Can Clean An Oil Painting

   [18]July 18, 2015 by [19]3HdyLMN

   Central AR art can be cleaned if you know what you are doing. I mean,
   if you find original landscape paintings for sale or what have you, you
   might need to clean them occasionally. Knowing how to do this yourself
   can save you a ton of money.

   You can read more about [20]Central AR art at this site, and find
   [21]original landscape paintings for sale there too. Hey, why not kill
   two birds with one stone, right?

   Someone recently  was seeking advice about cleaning a landscape oil
   painting:

   “My grandma did several oil paintings before she passed away. They are
   charming, however just beneficial to our family. My mother, a hefty
   smoker, hung a little oil paint (about 12″ x 18”) in her small studio
   apartment for several years. Today she is selling, and gave me the
   painting. It is sticky and also drippy with smoke residue.

   My regional art gallery really wants virtually $200 to cleanse it!

   Is there a home-remedy that I could attempt? Certainly, I do not intend
   to damage it, yet it’s not a valuable piece, as well as I simply desire
   it cleansed sufficient to await my kitchen area (still life with wine
   and fruit). Thanks for any sort of insight you can offer!”.

   I can’t make any sort of assurances (due to the fact that I’m not a
   curator) concerning the security of these methods for your particular
   repaint. However I can inform you exactly what I do to cleanse the
   paintings I have.

   1. The most safe alternative, but won’t work on sticky locations is to
   use a really soft brush to get rid of dust and also residue bits
   (incredibly soft paintbrush, child toothbrush, shaving brush, that kind
   of thing). You could acquire a micro add-on package for your vacuum
   that has small brushes (under an inch in diameter) for much deeper
   cleansing (do not scrub the area with the bristles, though– just light
   bulb, round passes). If that doesn’t function, you can use a completely
   dry rubber sponge simply put strokes throughout the surface area,
   however just if the surface isn’t damaged or half-cracked. It gets
   every last little bit of dirt and soot, yet likely will not deal with
   the truly sticky parts.

   2. The other choice is to use soft, clean cloths and water with a few
   declines of meal cleaning agent. If you could get rid of the structure
   to test this on the side or edge of the painting first, do so. Enjoy
   the area of the painting as well as check the cloths to see exactly
   what’s coming off, and certainly if the paint shades are taking off,
   stop cleaning. Attempt simply moist cloths in the beginning, swab the
   repaint, no scrubbing up. If she painted on canvas, beware not to
   extend the canvas by pushing too hard. If moist cloths aren’t working,
   make use of a little bit much more water, merely be cautious that water
   could seep under varnish, if there is any, which if the paint is slim,
   and the canvas or board gets wet, it could shrink or warp as well as
   cause fractures in the paint.

   I have actually cleaned my own paintings through this, but a
   conservator would certainly wring my neck if I ever tried it at a
   gallery! I have actually likewise utilized rubbing alcohol on a cotton
   ball for actually bad areas … terrifying, yet it works. Use a little
   quantity of liquor.

   If these approaches do not work, it could be worth it to ask around at
   the gallery to see if there is a conservator’s apprentice or assistant
   working there. Ask around unofficially by consulting the security
   personnel, reception team, gallery shop clerks, and so on. He/she may
   be going to check out your painting to recommend a synthetic cleaning
   agent or clean it for a lower price (under the table on his/her own
   time). You can also examine antique as well as framing stores to see if
   they have reduced rates for cleaning services.
