[10]Preserving Defunct Online Games: A Proposal

   Private servers or "shards" have been a staple of game preservation
   efforts for years, and they've expanded the life of games beyond
   developer support for many gamers. Even for currently-maintained games,
   many servers are created to mimic games as they existed in prior
   versions, such as Everquest in its original form, or Ultima Online.
   However, these efforts are often closed and protected, seemingly as a
   competitive, capitalistic effort between server [11]»

[14]On Toxic Online Communities

   Aggressive behavior is a staple of Internet discourse, from the day the
   term flame-war was coined to today's trolling. It's hard to argue that
   aggression and argument isn't a basic part of daily life when
   communicating with people over the Internet. We are desensitized to the
   idea of someone becoming unreasonably aggressive over disagreement or
   disillusionment online, because it happens so often. In my experience
   the level of vitriol spread [15]»

[18]RAII, Drop and foreign libraries

   RAII, or Resource Acquisition Is Initialization, is a programming
   policy that was popularized with C++, and one that Rust proudly puts at
   the forefront of its standard library and conventions. This core tenet
   of API design ensures that well-written Rust code has no dependency on
   global state and that everything has a well-defined lifetime.
   Considering that one of Rust's unique features is an elaborate borrow
   checker that explicitly handles the [19]»

[23]Running Rust code on the 3DS 2: Electric Boogaloo

   A few months ago I wrote a guide on compiling rust code to the 3DS, and
   an accompanying wrapper library for libctru. Unfortunately, that didn't
   work beyond trivial examples. However, months later I have figured out
   how to get the libcompiler-rt intrinsics built for the Nintendo 3DS.
   Updated September 17, 2015: alloc crate now works, meaning collections
   now works as well. Without further adieu, I present rust3ds-template
   and the previous [24]»

[28]Piston SDL window with Sound

   With the 0.7.0 release of the sdl2 crate, it is now much easier to
   manage subsystem initialization across libraries. This means it's now
   very easy to set up audio through SDL when using the
   pistoncore-sdl2_window crate as a backend for the Piston game engine;
   the SDL context is not locked behind the backend in such a way that
   lifetimes get in the way of initializing other desired [29]»
