               o Spread information about the game itself! Many people
                 (including myself) tend to focus on Lab Zero and their
                 situation in relation to Indivisible, but it doesn’t tell
                 people who don’t know who Lab Zero Games are or what
                 Skullgirls is why funding Indivisible would be a good
                 idea! Base your information on the prototype but remember
                 to include that it’s not a finalized concept for the
                 gameplay itself and that player input will be considered
                 by LZ (and already has in the making of the prototype)!
               o Play the prototype! Tell other people about the
                 prototype! Spread the prototype around and tell people
                 about the love and care that went into the creation of
                 just this prototype, give them accurate information
                 regarding the making of it and how it’s NOT a demo or
                 even perfectly representative of what the game will be if
                 it’s funded! It’s something LZ wrapped together in three
                 months just for the sake of promoting their product
                 simply because they care so much about the game they want
                 to make!
               o Draw fanart!! Draw lots and lots of fanart! Let people
                 see the characters LZ made and be vocal about your
                 support of it! I know lots of people feel like it’s
                 hopeless because of how much money they still need to be
                 funded, but if you don’t shut up about it and keep
                 promoting the game through art or videos or any other
                 means, more people will hear about it!
               o Meet misconceptions with calmness! When people are
                 cynical towards the crowdfunding model, counter them with
                 simple facts about LZ’s plans! Watch the videos where
                 Mike Z himself gives informative information about what
                 it takes to make a game ([513]here and [514]here), and
                 use this information in your arguments! Try not to guilt
                 trip people, though; I can see how that could be
                 counterproductive and ultimately work against the
                 campaign itself.
               o Whenever you talk about Indivisible, ALWAYS INCLUDE A
                 LINK TO THE CAMPAIGN AND THE PROTOTYPE! People need to
                 know where to go to support the game! Make people WANT to
                 support it, be positive and friendly!

     We’ve passed $500k, 1/3 of the fixed goal, and there’s a little over
     2 weeks left to spread it around and convince people to fund it. If
     we continue to talk about the game positively and spread correct
     information about the game itself, we can do this. It’s not over
     until IGG says it’s over, and it’s not over for at least another 2
     weeks.
     [515]Support Indivisible. Play the prototype. Be optimistic and
     positive.

     I worked for the prototype, and I’ll probably be working for the
     full game if it gets funded!
     Go check out the awesome characters that have been revealed so far,
     play the prototype, and spread the word~

     THERE’S A YURI GAME GETTING TRANSLATED AND RELEASED ON STEAM SOON
     AND IT LOOKS ADORABLE!
     THE PREMISE IS ABOUT TWO GHOST GIRLS WHO DIED AND THEN FELL IN LOVE
     AS GHOSTS AND THEY WANT TO DO THE SIN BUT DON’T KNOW HOW SO THEY ASK
     FOR HELP AND SO THE PROTAG HAS TO TURN THE WHOLE SCHOOL GAY FOR
     THEIR RESEARCH AND IT LOOKS SO CUTE

     Do we have a release date yet?
     Also, completely in love with Ano’s whole look.

     This looks like it will be VERY relevant to my interests…

     Looks like its time for me to get a Steam account.

            Kamisama Artist: Yayoi Takatsuki (CV: Mayako Nigo) Album: THE
            IDOLM@STER ANIM@TION MASTER Namassuka SPECIAL 03 Year: 2012 ♫
            Originally sung by Kana Uemura ♫ can someone please explain to
            me what this song is about.. is she really singing about a
            godly toilet? i dont understand It’s a lovely though sad
            little folk-like song about a girl and her grandmother she
            lived with when she was younger.The title of the song is from
            when she, as a child, did not want to help clean the toilet
            one day but her grandmother said that there’s a goddess in it
            and if you clean it very well then one can become as beautiful
            as said goddess.The song continues as the girl grows older and
            becomes distant from her grandmother, arguing and starting to
            not come home as often. The grandmother at this point has
            become very frail and has to stay in the hospital. And, though
            the granddaughter visited her the day before, soon she passed
            away.The last verses has her realizing that her grandmother
            was the one who taught her well and still loves her even
            though she wasn’t a good grandchild. She regrets the time
            they’ve become separated and argued.”I had a dream to become a
            good wife today I’m going tomake the toilet shine
            aloneGrandmaGrandmaThank youGrandmaThank youfrom the bottom of
            my heart”Lyrics here This song is actually very heart
            breaking. I remember doing the livestream of the albums and
            linked the lyrics to this song and everyone was almost in
            tears. Yayoi sang this very well and her emotions shine
            through. This is probably my favorite cover of hers.
