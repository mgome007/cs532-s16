    1. [6]Pipelines and Categoricals Mon 04 January 2016
       By [7]Tom Augspurger
       My favorite feature of scikit-learn is its pipelines. These are a
       nice convenience for putting together a chain of operations from
       raw data to classifier. More importantly, they help prevent
       training data from leaking into your validation, so I use them
       whenever possible.
       Pandas somewhat recently added a [8]Categorical dtype ...
    2. [9]Feature Complete Sun 04 October 2015
       By [10]Tom Augspurger
       Getting involved with pandas a couple years ago turned out to be
       one of the most fruitful choices I've made. I've learned so much
       from the other contributors (the ones who really do a ton of work,
       unlike me) like [11]Jeff, [12]Stephan, [13]Joris, [14]Masaaki, and
       others.
       That said ...
    3. [15]Dynamic Programming Sat 03 October 2015
       By [16]Tom Augspurger
       Eight months ago, Trey Causey wrote a [17]post about modeling
       expected points in football, with an emphasis on uncertainty. With
       my twisted economist's mind, I mentioned that it seemed like
       dynamic programming could be used in this situation, and indeed it
       would feature in a future post of Trey ...
    4. [18]Practical Pandas--Part 1 Thu 01 January 2015
       By [19]Tom Augspurger
       This is the first post in a series where I'll show how I use pandas
       on real-world datasets.
       For this post, we'll look at data I collected with [20]Cyclemeter
       on my daily bike ride to and from school last year. I had to
       manually start and stop the ...
    5. [21]Tidy Data in Action Thu 01 January 2015
       By [22]Tom Augspurger
       [23]Hadley Whickham wrote a famous paper (for a certain definition
       of famous) about the importance of [24]tidy data when doing data
       analysis. I want to talk a bit about that, using an example from a
       StackOverflow post, with a solution using [25]pandas. The
       principles of tidy data aren't language ...
    6. [26]Tacking the CPS (part 4) Mon 19 May 2014
       By [27]Tom Augspurger
       As a reminder, the CPS interviews households 8 times over the
       course of 16 months. They're interviewed for 4 months, take 8
       months off, and are interviewed four more times. So if your first
       interview was in month \(m\), you're also interviewed in months
       $$m + 1, m + 2, m + 3, m + 12, m + 13, m + 14, m + 15$$ ...
    7. [28]Tackling the CPS (Part 3) Mon 19 May 2014
       By [29]Tom Augspurger
       As a reminder, we have a dictionary that looks like
         id  length  start  end
0    HRHHID      15      1   15
1   HRMONTH       2     16   17

    8. [30]Quiz 10 Review Thu 01 May 2014
       By [31]Tom Augspurger

Section A01
       This quiz focused on exponential smoothing. Make sure that you know
       about moving averages and autocorrelation too.

#1
       You needed to find the biggest decline in the time series. You
       should never have to guess in stats, and I'm worried that some of
       you just looked at ...
    9. [32]Quiz 9 Review Thu 10 April 2014
       By [33]Tom Augspurger
       Don't forget your section number!

Section A01

#2
       Remember that for the modified best conservative model, we still
       care about the significance of all the predictors other than the
       ones that must be included.

#3
       Quite a few people are still giving point estimates (just
       \(\hat{y}\)) when the ...
   10. [34]Quiz 8 Review Fri 04 April 2014
       By [35]Tom Augspurger

#1
       The test statistic for \(H_0: \beta_1 = \beta_2 = 0\) is the \(F\)
       statistic. It's what we'll use for when we're testing multiple
       parameters at once.
       Several people had \(\beta_1 = 0\) or \(\beta_2 = 0\). This is
       wrong; it should be and not or. This is actually an important ...
