				<p>Through our partnership with Wasabi Ventures we have collaborated on a Venture Capital Bootcamp as well as continued educational opportunities for our entrepreneurs scheduled for 2016.

Their programs and workshops are targeted to meet the needs of a given region and provide participants with tools and strategies for success. Additionally, their team provides continued support and mentorship to the entrepreneurs, which makes them an invaluable member of Betamore’s coworking community.</p>
