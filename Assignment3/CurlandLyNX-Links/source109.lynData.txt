[27]AWARDS INTELLIGENCER: Rooney Mara Revered by Cate Blanchett and Todd
Haynes – Quendrith Johnson reports

   Posted by [28]Quendrith Johnson on Feb 13, 2016 | [29]0 comments

   [30]rooney mara To hear fellow Oscar-nom, two-time winner Cate
   Blanchett, gush about her Best Supporting Actress and Carol consort
   Rooney Mara, is almost as shocking as when Blanchett uses the word
   “startling” to describe Mara’s acting chops. Next “The Great Cate”
   cobbles together some descriptive sentences worthy of a literary titan.
   It’s more of a love letter than an endorsement, in keeping with the
   forbidden 1950′s women-in-love angle in Carol. Read more on [31]AWARDS

[33]AWARDS INTELLIGENCER: Why Stallone Might Win the Oscar – Quendrith
Johnson comments

   Posted by [34]Quendrith Johnson on Feb 10, 2016 | [35]0 comments

   [36]CreedJordanSly16 The deep rooted bond between Hollywood icon
   Sylvester Stallone and tinseltown’s phenom director Ryan Coogler comes
   from shared experience: they were both homeless and from that position
   of deprivation fought their way to the movie major leagues. Stallone,
   in Santa Barbara to accept the Santa Barbara International Film
   Festival’s Montecito Award, credits Coogler with creating greatness in
   Creed and talks about finding common ground with the young filmmaker
   who lived in his car while attending film school. Read more in

[39]AWARDS INTELLIGENCER: Sacha Pfeiffer talks SPOTLIGHT, Journalism and

   Posted by [40]Quendrith Johnson on Feb 8, 2016 | [41]0 comments

   [42]RacheSacha One thing is certain, in Oscar Best Film contender
   Spotlight, Rachel McAdams is well-cast as Boston Globe investigative
   reporter Sacha Pfeiffer, who proves to be an intensely interesting
   character in her own right. A key member of the Pulitzer Prize-winning
   team that cracked open the priest sex-abuse scandal that’s plumbed in
   the film, and dethroned Boston’s Catholic powerbroker Cardinal Law,
   Pfeiffer packed a impactful editorial punch. She still does when it
   comes to social and political issues. But when you meet her, she tilts
   her head to one side, leans back a bit and welcome you into her zone.

[45]AWARDS INTELLIGENCER: Johnny Depp Nabs Leonard Maltin’s Golden Statuette
— Quendrith Johnson reports

   [48]JohnnyDeppHand-300x168 Leonard Maltin just tells it like it is, but
   with such heart and insight for viewers. So much so that the elder
   statesman of cinema had a life achievement award renamed after him at
   the Santa Barbara International Film Festival (SBIFF) in 2015: The
   Maltin Modern Master Award. Last night his legacy was cemented as
   A-List actor Johnny Depp, or “Jonathan Christopher Depp,” as Maltin
   called him, came to Santa Barbara International Film Festival to accept
   The Other Golden Statuette. Read more on [49]AWARDS INTELLIGENCER

[51]AWARDS INTELLIGENCER: Frontrunner SPOTLIGHT, #OscarsSoWhite, The
Contentious Award Season – Quendrith Johnson comments

   Posted by [52]Quendrith Johnson on Jan 25, 2016 | [53]0 comments

   If Oscar-winner Sean Penn can go interview El Chapo, then the state of
   journalism really is in trouble — oh, never mind, this is just
   indicative of how movie people perceive and interpret the craft of
   journalistic writing and reporting. A cocky Penn goes on Charlie Rose
   to call out those who ‘don’t think I’m a real journalist,’ while having
   committed a de facto ethical violation of the profession by
   grandstanding for Rolling Stone with a fugitive, mass-murdering, drug
   Lord. But, if turnabout is fair play, most journalists would happily
   take a shot at starring in his next straight-to-video motion picture.
   But what are we really discussing here, writing, reporting, The Death
   of The Media, The Rise of The Internet? Nope. This inelegant segue
   leads directly to our Oscar front runner for Best Picture, Spotlight.

[56]AWARDS INTELLIGENCER: Golden Globes Wake Up – Quendrith Johnson comments

   Posted by [57]Quendrith Johnson on Dec 10, 2015 | [58]0 comments

   [59]GoldenGlobeLogo What’s cool about the Golden Globes is that
   celebrities can do things there that they wouldn’t dream of doing at
   other award shows. Can you imagine Jodie Foster coming out during an
   Oscar speech? But that’s exactly what she did at the Golden Globes,
   albeit years after everyone in Hollywood had known and forgotten about
   her sexual preference. Foster knew there would be no theme music
   rushing her off stage, nor any censorship, so in 2013 she accepted
   herself while accepting the Cecil B. DeMille Award from The Hollywood
   Foreign Press Association (HFPA). Even the word “Foreign” in their name
   is slightly strange and outdated, almost anachronistic. Read more in

[62]AWARDS INTELLIGENCER: Praise for CHI-RAQ – Quendrith Johnson Comments

   Posted by [63]Quendrith Johnson on Dec 4, 2015 | [64]0 comments

   [65]ChiRaqOS “Has the world gone crazy?” This is the refrain coming
   from the San Bernardino, Calif., and the Paris mass shootings; but it
   also echoes in filmmaker Spike Lee’s new movie Chi-Raq. While the film
   is ostensibly a high-art adaptation of Aristophanes’ Greek satirical
   classic Lysistrata set in the inner city, it is a call-to-action on the
   shock topic of gun-related violence worldwide. Read more in [66]AWARDS

   Gretchen McCourt
   With the disparity in representation of women in the director’s chair

   it’s no surprise that ArcLight Cinemas just presented an “Inaugural

[74]Hollywood Insider Katherine Kramer on Trending Feminism and the 2016
Oscars – Quendrith Johnson reports

   Posted by [75]Quendrith Johnson on Oct 10, 2015 | [76]0 comments

   [77]katkramercropped Hollywood insider Katherine Kramer (Stanley’s
   daughter) discusses the feminist movie trend and its possible 2016
   Oscars impact. Making women’s issue movies got a huge boost with
   Patricia Arquette’s impassioned 2015 Equal Pay Oscar acceptance speech,
   leading to a proliferation of 2016 Oscar-worthy femme-centric projects,
   legislation for equal rights and even a federal investigation of
   Hollywood’s disparate salaries, based on numbers leaked in the Sony
   hack. Meryl Streep, Jane Fonda and other A-listers have joined a chorus
   actresses clamoring for equal representation for women behind and in
   front of the cameras. Katherine Kramer’s take on feminist trending is
   smartly insightful and fascinating. Read more in [78]AWARDS

[80]EAST LA INTERCHANGE: “If This Film Could Vote” With Director Betsy Kalin
– Quendrith Johnson comments

   Posted by [81]Quendrith Johnson on Sep 24, 2015 | [82]0 comments

   [83]XaviMoreno No one disputes that there are a lot of LA’s, from the
   ancient Los Angeles of Pueblo and Missions, to Hollywood and LA Film
   Noir, to the Watts Towers, to Dog Town Surf Culture, to CGI pioneers
   and Silicon Beach. But director Betsy Kalin’s new documentary East LA
   Interchange is likely one of the few to explore the neighborhood known
   as Boyle Heights. This film will open tomorrow at The Hollywood Film
   Festival with narrator Danny Trejo (Machete) piecing together the
   topical patchwork of different ethnic communities that make up this
   oft-overlooked backbone of Los Angeles culture. There are
   Mexican-Americans, Japanese-Americans, Anglo-Americans,
   African-Americans, everything in between and a thriving Jewish
   community here. [84]Read more>>

   [89]Donald Margulies

   Donald Margulies
   There’s really only one thing you need to know about Donald Margulies,
   who won the Pulitzer Prize for his play “Dinner With Friends” (1998) —
   he will field any question graciously. This generosity is the defining
   characteristic of someone at the top of their craft. So when The End of
   The Tour (starring Jason Segel and Jesse Eisenberg) opens in theaters
   on July 31, Margulies, as the screenwriter who adapted the David Lipsky
   memoir about David Foster Wallace, will be discovered by a whole new
   generation of film audiences. [90]Read more>> [91]read more

   [101]manglehorn You could say director David Gordon Green’s late-career
   Al Pacino-starrer Manglehorn is about the violence of everyday
   conversations, the hurt we inflict in the routine course of ordinary
   discussions, and how these wounds last a lifetime. But, just as easily,
   Manglehorn could be considered a snow globe souvenir of the emotional
   lifespan and extraordinary range of screen legend Pacino.  Fortunately
   director David Gordon Green, to his credit, simplifies the hero

   [113]MaggieGyllenhaal-234x300 Ever since Maggie Gyllenhaal went public
   with the fact that she lost a role, at 37, as a love interest for a
   55-year-old leading male because she was “too old,” the internet lit up
   with shock. But why should we be surprised? Disparity in casting
   leading men and women has been around since the Silent Era. So has a
   distorted view of the female psyche on film. Not only a distortion as
   to who and what women represent, but how the props, set dressing,
   costumes, conspire with the script, even the director, to really hammer
   the point home. [114]Read on…

[116]Honoring Agnès Varda at Cannes 2015 – Quendrith Johnson comments

   Posted by [117]Quendrith Johnson on May 24, 2015 | [118]0 comments

   [119]agnes varda French New Wave Director Agnès Varda is the first
   female filmmaker to receive the Cannes Film Festival’s coveted Palme
   d’Or in the festival’s 68 year history. Varda, who turns 87 on May 30,
   has made a vital and lasting personal stamp on the international world
   of cinema and its aesthetics, and has guided many burgeoning filmmakers
   to self expression and successful careers. Varda’s cinema theories and
   practice are challenging in the best ways. Her concept of ‘cinecriture’
   distinguishes the art of writing for film from from other forms of
   literature, and she defines filmmaking as the art of making decisions
   that embrace the unquantifiable factors of faith and chance. [120]Read

   [125]good kill When Voltage Pictures President Nicolas Chartier got a
   wrist-slap for openly appealing to Academy voters on behalf of his
   project The Hurt Locker (2010), he may have been “uninvited” to the
   Oscars, but he certainly proved himself to be the rare creative

   [137]arquetteoscars406 This year’s Oscar wins have now turned into ad
   campaigns, as the studios scurry to make bank on their films’ golden
   statuettes. But there’s more to the story, and it involves selling
   strategies. For example, because Boyhood did’t sweep the Oscars, IFC
   Films will underplay Patricia Arquette’s Oscar win for Best Supporting
   Actress, and sell the movie’s three Golden Globe Awards. Even though
   Arquette’s Oscar win and acceptance speech were massively popular with

   years to be nominated, let alone score a César, or “French Oscar,” for
   Clouds of Sils Maria. But this historic first-ever win for an American,

   sentiment that predicts a two-way tug between veteran Michael Keaton
   and newcomer Eddie Redmayne, leaving Steve Carell, Bradley Cooper and
   Benedict Cumberbatch on the sidelines. To understand voter calculus,

[153]American Sniping: Backlash Against Celebrity Takes A Left Turn —
Quendrith Johnson comments

   There have been backlashes against celebrity before, from Ingrid
   Bergman and Rita Hayworth being pilloried in Congress in 1949-1950, for
   Roberto Rossellini and Aly Khan, respectively, to Liz Taylor getting a
   media shellacking for her multiples in marriage. But these fits of
   pique have usually come from outside Hollywood. That all changed this
   past November, when the backlash against celebrity was revealed to come
   from inside the dream factory, specifically as a result of the Sony

   Just as the biggest breaking story drops in her lap, filmmaker Laura

   then 29-year-old Edward Joseph Snowden, an outsourced infrastructure
   analyst working for a subcontractor to the NSA. And the rest is
   history. Encrypted emails came out of the blue to Poitras almost
   exactly two years ago, January, 2013. The implications for average
   netizens were astounding. [162]Read more>>
