   There you are wrong. The graveyards are full of middling swordsmen.
   Best not to be a swordsman at all than a middling swordsman.

   I am a Bioinformatics Scientist at [4]Bina Technologies, part of
   [5]Roche Sequencing. A little over 10 years ago, the Human Genome
   Project was complete after 10 years and $10 billion, which sequenced 3
   people. It was a monumental achievement unthinkable only a few years
   prior. Today, we can sequence a genome for roughly $1000 in a single
   day. However, sequencing output outpaces Moore's Law, and data analysis
   and management has become the bottleneck of genomic studies. Bina
   Technologies is solving the problem, in order to fully realize the
   potential of modern genomics and personalized medicine.

   Check out [6]SomaticSeq, a machine learning algorithm we have developed
   at Bina to detect somatic mutations in cancer sequencing. SomaticSeq
   has placed Bina [7]No. 1 in INDEL and No. 2 in SNV in the Stage 5 of
   the [8]ICGC-TCGA DREAM Somatic Mutation Calling Challenge. Our
   [9]paper describing the method is an [10]Editor's pick in Genome
   Biology.

   Check out my friend's start up company [11]TargetPlex Genomics. He has
   a new way to perform multiplex PCR, in order to amplify regions of
   interest in the genome for targeted deep sequencing.

   My Web Pages Elsewhere:

   I maintain two identical mirrors in two different locations:
     (1) [13]my ultra-low-voltage Intel Atom server at home,
     (2) [14]the UCLA Chemistry Department's server that I have user
   access to.

   My home server is powered by [22]Apache HTTP Server, running on 64-bit
   [23]Ubuntu Linux Server Edition 14.04.3 on an [24]Intel Atom D525.
   Why Intel Atom? Because its maximum power consumption is only 13 Watts.
   My home network is routed through a ASUS RT-N66R, with its factory
   firmware replaced by [25]DD-WRT.
   However, my Linux Server is physically attached to a Netgear WNDR3700
   v3, also with DD-WRT, set up as a [26]Wireless Repeater Bridge.
   If your feel this page loads too slowly, blame my [27]ISP. They only
   gave me a measly 1.5 Mbps upload speed! Google Fiber, where are you!?
