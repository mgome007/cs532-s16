     * [4]Own Your Email
       It's the first of the year and you know what that means:
       resolutions. One change I'm making this year is taking back my
       email address. For years one of the most important pieces of my
       personal identity has been in the control of a large corporation.
       While this hasn't posed...

     * [6]Simple Rails Deployments with Net/SSH
       Recently I created a small Rails app as a sales/marketing site for
       the startup I am working at. The site is very basic with just a few
       models and controllers. We time came to deploy the site, Capistrano
       felt to big, but we didn't want to have to manually ssh...

     * [10]Major Change to Hash.from_xml in Rails 2.3.4
       Recently after upgrading a Rails app to Rails 2.3.4 I noticed some
       calls from a SOAP service throwing errors. After a little
       investigation I found this commit: The problem is that since
       String#underscore lowercases the string, any Hashes created using
       Hash.from_xml with xml that contain any capital letters in the...

     * [12]Please Stop Making iPhone Specific Web Sites
       Apple markets the iPhone as a true Internet device comparable to
       its desktop alternatives. One of its killer features is a real web
       browser. No longer are we stuck with mangled mobile versions with a
       quarter of the features. No longer do we need our laptops to use
       the web ...

     * [14]Authentication Setup with Merb Auth and Merb Stack
       This week I was lucky enough to spend two days at the Merb Sprint.
       At the sprint I spent some time testing the install and setup
       process for the Merb Stack and merb_auth (the merb authentication
       gem). Dan Neighman (aka hassox) spent some time with me going over
       the merb_auth...

     * [16]My First Lesson In Programming
       Today I stumbled upon the first program I ever wrote. It's an
       interesting story looking back twenty years later. When I was
       somewhere between 8-10 years old my uncle gave my family our first
       computer, a Coleco Adam. Along with the computer we were given the
       now classic book BASIC...

     * [18]Merb Overheard Launched
       Recently, Merb has been getting a lot of attention. With
       significant changes leading up to the 1.0 release, and now with
       it's own conference, the Merb community needs a centralized place
       where relevant information can be found. Say hello to Merb
       Overheard. Merb Overheard follows the planet-type aggregation sites
       similar...

     * [20]Installing a Ruby on Rails Plugin from a Github Branch
       One of the coolest things about Git is how easy it makes working
       with branches. Rails has been playing catch up with Git's
       distributed methodologies and recently took a nice step forward.
       Previously you could only use ./script/plugin install to install
       from the master branch of a Github repository. Now you...

     * [22]Out with the New, In with the Old
       Recently I switched from Feather, a Merb blogging app, to
       Wordpress. Here is a small run down on why I made the switch. First
       off let me say this about Feather. It is an amazing application. I
       have contributed a bit to its development and can vouch on the
       quality...

     * [24]Update a Github Fork from the Original Repo
       Feather Blog has made some great progress recently and when looking
       to update my fork I found myself staring at my repo not sure what
       to do. My wonderful Github didn't give me a one-click way to pull
       updates from the original repository (or any other fork for that
       matter)....

     * [28]New Workflow Tools
       I recently added a couple of new tools to my project workflow,
       Hoptoad and Pivotal Tracker. Hoptoad is a Rails plugin that acts a
       replacement for the exception_notifier from the wonderfully
       talented Thoughbot team (of Paperclip and Shoulda fame). Hoptoad is
       a hosted solution that keeps track of duplicate bugs,...

     * [30]Trust Your Source Control
       Often times I see something like some_file_bak or image.jpg.old in
       a repository. Renaming the original to a new file name only makes
       things more confusing because now the _bak file has no history.
       Trust you code control and use it as it is intended.

     * [32]Merb 0.9.3 and Feather Error: undefined method `empty?' for

       Recently when setting up this blog using Feather, a new blog app
       written with Merb, I started getting the following error when
       hitting the home page: undefined method `empty?' for nil:NilClass
       Turns out there is a bug is merb-cache (part of merb-more) that is
       causing the problem. It's patched in...
