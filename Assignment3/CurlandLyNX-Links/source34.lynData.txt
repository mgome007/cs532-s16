   [11]concretin asked:

   What are some flaws you see in Comics characters wveryone loves?

A

   [12]mattfractionblog:

     i don’t think i do; it feels like finding a flaw in a hammer.
     there’s nothing wrong with a hammer, inherently. unless you’re
     trying to drive in screws – y’know?

   Hi, all. I (Lee) have been writing and finishing a very exciting pitch
   that, sadly, we can’t show you anything from because the pictures are
   super duper spoilery. SO I’ve done up a few digital portraits of the
   characters from the book. The top one is Yael Meade and the lower is
   Issac Tillman-Voss. I’ve a few more to go, so stay tuned in the next
   couple weeks. These are the same ones I did those style boards for,
   before. I’m thinking of doing a very limited number of digital portrait
   commissions in the next couple months.  Hi, all. I (Lee) have been

     [tumblr_inline_o0wdk5a4Nw1qdpxig_400.png]

     The Prism Comics Queer Press Grant is open for submissions until
     March 1, 2016! Winning the QPG provided me with the funds to print
     the first copies of O Human Star Chapter 1, and I know there are a
     lot of outstanding LGBTQ cartoonists who would benefit from an
     opportunity like this, so please give it a shot!

     [64]m-arci-a:

     daily life of a digital artist:
     * is that a not coloured spot or a stain on my monitor
     * I didn’t save for at least 2 hours god is real
     * my playlist ended 1,5 h ago I’ve been drawing in silence this whole
       time
     * ‘ “asdf11.png” already exists. Do you want to overwrite? ‘
     * I resized this very part of a picture but now it looks too small so
       let’s ctrl+z ohMYGOD IT’S SO B I G
     * this idea seemed cooler yesterday at 3 am
     * I want to pee but right now I’m doing so well and if I go I will
       leavE THE ZONE
     * opacity 67% or 68% I can’t decide
     * well this pic looks nice //*flips it horizontally*// I regret
       having eyes
     * where the fuck is my pen

     traditional artist:
     * I can’t find the right color, why do I not have the exact color I
       need
     * Oh hey, let’s share this online! *Spends next 5 minutes trying to
       take a good picture of it/scan it in*
     * IT SMUDGED DAMN IT
     * I have ink all over my hands and it’s not coming off
     * Do not make a mistake lining it, do not make a mistak- FUCK
     * My eraser has been obliterated by mistakes
     * I SPILLED *insert drink/food item here* ALL OVER MY DRAWING
     * My sketchbook fell apart/ripped again
     * where the fuck is my pen

   As someone who married an artist, I have heard all of these things
   coming out of their mouth.

   Especially the pen thing.
