      My thoughts on data mining, machine learning, programming languages,
      open-source software and general nerdery.

   [5]It’s Been a While

   This past three years has really flown. It’s time for me to finally get
   back to my roots and also start blogging more, like I did previously.
   My last post was about Strata 2013. During this time period, I was
   taking a break from working full-time to finish a Ph.D. dissertation
   that I had neglected during my previous two positions. I learned my
   lesson the hard way, never work externally if you want a Ph.D. in a
   reasonable amount of time! I quickly got my dissertation from an intro
   to the first 65 pages or so during this gap. I then received an offer
   from Facebook. I was ready to move to Silicon Valley and enjoy all the
   things I had been envious over for so many years: the perks, the
   culture of innovation and intelligence, and the technology community.
   This was an opportunity I could not pass, and the dissertation went on
   the back-burner for another two years as I spent the majority of my
   waking hours, both during the week and the weekend… and on holidays…
   coding into a frenzy. I was looking forward to living in a world where
   I was entrenched in the technology and data ecosystem. But…

The Grass Isn’t Greener on the Other Side

   The technology community is definitely there and is obviously very
   strong, but it isn’t what I thought it would be. Due to the sheer size
   of the industry, meetups and other events were very impersonal compared
   to what I was used to in the LA area. Additionally, it seems that most
   of that original Silicon Valley startup energy has moved to San
   Francisco. To get to meetups, I would spend hours on shuttles,
   Caltrain, BART and Muni getting to SoMa and then being disappointed at
   the frequent company pitches instead of discussing actual science and
   technology. Not all groups are like that, as I attended plenty of
   meetups that were technical and whetted my appetite to learn more. Of
   course, there was also the question if I could even get into the
   meetup. The majority of the meetup groups I was a part of would fill up
   in a few hours for a hot topic or engaging speaker with waiting lists
   sometimes 100 to 200 people long. The final blow was that my attendance
   assumed I could get away from my projects at work, which I really could
   not. My technology community ended up being the others at the company,
   which may have been helpful for my job, but gave me a narrower focus
   than I wanted, and was just one more thing that kept me at work.
   Meetups are not the only important thing in the technology community
   though. I did attend a few conferences such as [6]ACM SIGCIKM,
   [7]BayLearn, [8]Strata 2014 (but for recruiting), and I spoke at
   [9]PyData when it was held at Facebook. To be fully immersed in the
   technology community and experience, it seems one now needs to live in
   San Francisco, and San Francisco is definitely not the city for me — I
   am more of a Silicon Valley suburb type but the energy wasn’t the same.

   I am not alone when I say that I spent most of my waking life working.
   Since I had moved there for a job, and I didn’t have any roots, friends
   or family in the area I thought it would make sense for me to do this.
   But, working at this rate took a toll on me physically, mentally and
   emotionally. Although there is a lot to do in the Bay Area, there
   really wasn’t any time to do it because of the work culture. And people
   didn’t seem to have time for me for the same reason. This is not true
   for everyone, but I found it much more true in the Bay Area than
   anywhere else I have lived. To add to the long work hours, this is not
   the first time I have been an “overachiever” in life — this is
   something I had been afflicted with since high school (the 90s).
   Not only is there stress from long hours and a lack of any outside
   world, [10]the Bay Area is extremely expensive — nobody argues against
   this point. My 850 square foot one-bedroom apartment in Mountain View
   is now on the market for $4200/month. [11]Buying a house is typically
   not practical for new and mid-career engineers unless they have been at
   a large company for a while, or had a big payout from a startup, or
   were willing to have a longer commute from outside of the valley. A
   small one-bedroom house can easily list at over one-million dollars in
   Mountain View and Palo Alto. Next, there are going to be n other
   bidders that also want the same house. It is incredibly common for
   already ridiculously overpriced houses in Palo Alto to sell for a lot
   more than the listing price. If you are single, you are going to need
   that tax writeoff, or you are in for a huge surprise at tax time. This
   lifestyle is not sustainable in the long run. And for me, it was an
   issue that does not make me miss the area much.
   On the other hand, many parts of the Bay Area are absolutely beautiful.
   From the green forests above Santa Cruz, to the pristine coastline from
   Monterey north, the green rolling hills in San Jose and the East Bay,
   to the bizarre other-worldly marshes along the bay. It was a dry two
   years so the weather was not all that different from LA.

   I learned a valuable lesson. It’s true that the grass isn’t greener on
   the other side. You can shower a person with free meals, free rides and
   other perks (I even forget what they were… they ended up not being
   important), but all it does is keep you at work, and keep you engaged
   with only that one part of your life. Your “friends” end up being at
   the company and ends up being a bad thing in such a competitive
   environment. Other perks like an onsite doctor, dentist and physical
   therapist may sound nice, but they were not up to par with services I
   received elsewhere, and again are just ways to keep you at work. These
   things are gimmicks. They are good to entice people, they are good to
   make life convenient, but they really are just ways to keep you at work
   and pay you less.

Burn Out: Time to Reflect and Slow Down

   When I returned to LA, I drove down Pacific Coast Highway and looked
   out to the ocean. As the orange winter sun beat on my face through the
   window, I could not believe it had been 2 years since I had taken that
   drive. That was not like me. I lived for the beach atmosphere and the
   sense of unwinding it provided me. At that moment, I realized that I
   wanted to slow down my “nerves” — not only back to my original levels,
   but even slower. I wanted to take time out for myself, not only to
   finish my research, but also to enjoy life, and think about what makes
   me happy both as a person and as a professional. I realized that in
   that two years, I lost myself and with each lonely day, I lost my
   passion for my interests and I did not have many hobbies other than
   working.
   For the past ten years, I’ve spent time in the Eastern Sierra but not
   nearly enough. I was finally able to buy a vacation home in [12]Mammoth
   and now have the time to enjoy it. I have spent the past several months
   hiking, mountain biking, snowshoeing and taking drives through some of
   nature’s finest beauty. The solitude and intrigue of the wilderness is
   very cleansing and good for the soul. I’ve also lost quite a bit of
   weight since leaving behind the free meals and becoming so active. I
   had always been a brisk walker, and always preferred to use my legs
   rather than my wheels, but this was the first time since college I did
   vigorous heart-pumping activity on a routine basis. When I look back, I
   realize it was not just the past three years that have burned me out.
   It’s the entire way I have been living my adulthood.

Things Have Changed

   I am not closing any doors in this post, but I have learned to value a
   sane work environment and work hours over perks and pure compensation.
   Rather than focus on compensation and working at a “hot” company, my
   intention is to do work that benefits the common good with respect to
   my interests, while providing me with the means to live, retire, and
   have funds available for my own hobbies and side projects. There is
   only one thing that I will not compromise on (ok, two): I must be able
   to wear shorts, and I must be able to have flexible hours. Whether or
   not to accept a position is now a lot more complex than looking at a
   company’s base product and having coding, machine learning and
   statistics in the job requirements/description. I do not want spend 1%
   of my time doing machine learning using some basic model (i.e. Naive
   Bayes or Logistic Regression) and the other 99% scaling it to billions
   of observations. Rather, I would like to be able to explore more on the
   machine learning side, and learn new algorithms and methods for
   prediction and classification. This does not mean that
   I completely want to move away from the systems engineering stuff, but
   it will really depend on the product and the team rather than just
   the company.
   For the time being, I am consulting and also mentoring a startup. I may
   continue to do that as my career, I may not. I have several ideas for
   startups that I may pursue, but I may not. Who knows, maybe I will
   return to the Bay Area (under the constraints I mentioned earlier), or
   I may not. I will probably return to being more active in the community
   like I used to be, but I have realized that there is a lot of noise,
   hype and ego in the blogosphere, Twittersphere, and these thousands of
   dollars conferences. There is something to be said by just doing my own
   thing. Maybe I have just grown as a professional, I don’t know. I just
   know that these things should be taken with a grain of salt.

Switching Fields?

   After a lot of introspection, I want to take a look at some other
   fields outside of “pure tech” including but not limited to:
     * Environmental and activity geospatial data. After living in the
       mountains, I’ve become very interested in environmental data,
       particularly using time series, GPS telemetry and geospatial
       analysis. My interest in this field has applications from
       everything from efficient placement of snowmobiles for SAR
       operations, to action sports and activity intelligence, even
       navigation.
     * Finance. Finance used to be on my list of “never ever.” After
       learning more about economics and Wall Street from my time in
       startups and Silicon Valley, I am also interested in some
       applications in finance. Machine learning is obviously very useful
       for automated investing, but data visualization has proven to be
       useful in manual transactions for me.
     * Education. My original draw to statistics was the field of
       psychometrics and the develop of educational assessments. I am
       considering going back in this direction. I am also interested in
       the educational technology sector improving the delivery of
       educational materials and assessment of learning. Of course, I may
       go into teaching altogether, most likely at the college level, or
       as some type of training consultant.
     * Aviation: Airliners and drones. People that know me well know that
       I love airports, airlines and flying. Aviation uses a lot of
       different data science techniques. Drones are an emerging
       technology and routing drones in the sky has become a challenge
       that companies are working on. Routing, both for drones and
       airliners, uses geospatial/map data and network/graph data and
       takes into account many variables that affect flight, airspace
       congestion, and airport/ground resource usage. Wait time and
       queuing theory is also very important for runway operations. There
       is a lot of game theory, network analysis, and other data science
       involved in pricing and scheduling of airliner flights. All of
       these challenges are interesting to me.
     * “Internet of Things.” It annoys me that the emerging field of
       embedded systems, their development and data processing has become
       yet another cheap buzzword like “big data” or the misuse of the
       term “data science.” Devices such as the Raspberry Pi, Arduino and
       custom printed circuit boards allow the masses to create new data
       collection devices that unobtrusively fit anywhere data need
       recording. While the data itself is interesting, in this one
       particular case, I am actually more interested in the hardware, and
       pure engineering side rather than the data science side.
     * Security is an exponentially growing field that has become pivotal
       not only for national security, but for privacy. Security is a
       field that is very interesting to me, but one I know very little
       about, and thus is an option for a more ambitious change of field.
       I can see it being a field I would be passionate about the more I
       learn about it. Security would be unchartered waters for me, but I
       do not see it as a field that will be disappearing anytime soon.

   After typing up this list and re-reading it, I realize I still have the
   same level of passion I always did, and perhaps my soul needed to focus
   on something else for a while. Now I just have to make the choices of
   which ones are the most rewarding, and which ones provide the best
   opportunities for me. In any job interview, there is always the “Do you
   have any questions for me/us?” Over the past several years, I have
   compiled a long list of questions. And if I do not like the answer, or
   if I can tell the interviewer is BSing the answer, abort! Perks and big
   names are not the key to happiness or a more fulfilled life — becoming
   a better person and being able to enjoy the process of life is.

[30]Summary of My First Trip to Strata #strataconf

   In this post I am goIing to summarize some of the things that I learned
   at Strata Santa Clara 2013. For now, I will only discuss the conference
   sessions as I have a much longer post about the tutorial sessions that
   I am still working on and will post at a later date. I will add to this
   post as the conference winds down.

   The slides for most talks will be available here but not all speakers
   will share their slides.

   This is/was my first trip to Strata so I was eagerly awaiting
   participating as an attendant. In the past, I had been put off by the
   cost and was also concerned that the conference would be an endless
   advertisement for the conference sponsors and Big Data platforms. I am
   happy to say that for the most part I was proven wrong. For easier
   reading, I am summarizing talks by topic rather than giving a laundry
   list schedule for a long day and also skip sessions that I did not find
   all that illuminating. I also do not claim 100% accuracy of this text
   as the days are very long and my ears and mind can only process so much
   data when I am context […]

[45]Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays!

   Wishing you all a very Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays and Happy New
   Year!

   An update on me. In October, I began working at Riot Games, the
   developers of League of Legends. It has been an amazing experience and
   has occupied the majority of my free time as has my dissertation. My
   New Year’s resolution this year is to dust the cobwebs off this blog!

   Have a safe holiday season!

   Here in California, I will be having Christmas in the Sand

[48]A New Data Toy -- Unboxing the Raspberry Pi

   Last week I received two Raspberry Pis in the mail from AdaFruit and
   just now have some time to play with them. The Raspberry Pi is a
   minimal computer system that is about the size of a credit card. In the
   embedded systems community, the excitement is for obvious reasons, but
   I strongly believe that such a device can help collect and use data to
   help us make better decisions because not only is it a computer, but it
   is small and portable.

   For development, Raspberry Pi can connect to a television (or other
   display) via HDMI or composite video (the “yellow” plug for those still
   stuck in the 1900s haha). A keyboard, mouse and other devices can be
   connected via two USB ports. A powered hub can provide support for even
   more devices. There are also various pins for connecting to a
   breadboard for analyzing analog signals, for a camera or for an
   external (or touchscreen) display. An SD Card essentially serves as the
   hard disk and probably a portion of the RAM. The more recent Model B
   ships with 256MB RAM. Raspberry Pi began shipping in February 2012 and
   these little guys have been very difficult to get a […]

[52]Adventures at My First JSM (Joint Statistical Meetings) #JSM2012

   During the past few decades that I have been in graduate school (no,
   not literally) I have boycotted JSM on the notion that “I am not a
   statistician.” Ok, I am a renegade statistician, a statistician by
   training. JSM 2012 was held in San Diego, CA, one of the best places to
   spend a week during the summer. This time, I had no excuse not to go,
   and I figured that in order to get my Ph.D. in Statistics, I have to
   have been to at least one JSM. […]

[59]OpenPaths and a Progressive Approach to Privacy

   OpenPaths is a service that allows users with mobile phones to transmit
   and store their location. It is an initiative by the New York Times
   that allows users to use their own data, or to contribute their
   location data for research projects and perhaps startups that wish to
   get into the geospatial space. OpenPaths brands itself as “a secure
   data locker for personal location information.” There is one aspect
   where OpenPaths is very different from other services like Google
   Latitude: Only the user has access to his/her own data and it is never
   shared with anybody else unless the user chooses to do so.
   Additionally, initiatives that wish to use a user’s location data must
   be asked personally via email (pictured below), and the user has the
   ability to deny the request.The data shared with each initiative
   provides only location, and not other data that may be personally
   identifiable such as name, email, browser, mobile type etc. In this
   sense, OpenPaths has provided a barebones platform for the collection
   and storage of location information. Google Latitude is similar, but
   the data stored on Google’s servers is obviously used by other Google
   services without explicit user permission.

   The service is also opt-in, that […]

[65]SIAM Data Mining 2012 Conference

   Note: This would have been up a lot sooner but I have been dealing with
   a bug on and off for pretty much the past month!

   From April 26-28 I had the pleasure to attend the SIAM Data Mining
   conference in Anaheim on the Disneyland Resort grounds. Aside from
   KDD2011, most of my recent conferences had been more “big data” and
   “data science” oriented, and I wanted to step away from the hype and
   just listen to talks that had more substance.

   Attending a conference on Disneyland property was quite a bizarre
   experience. I wanted to get everything I could out of the conference,
   but the weather was so nice that I also wanted to get everything out of
   Disneyland as I could. Seeing adults wearing Mickey ears carrying
   Mickey shaped balloons, and seeing girls dressed up as their favorite
   Disney princesses screams “fun” rather than “business”, but I managed
   to make time for both.

   The first two days started with a plenary talk from industry or
   research labs. After a coffee break, there were the usual breakout
   sessions followed by lunch. During my free 90 minutes, I ran over to
   Disneyland and California Adventure both days to eat lunch. I managed
   to […]

[71]My Interview about the Statistics Major

   Recently, I participated in an email interview about what being a
   Statistics major entailed, how I got interested in the field and the
   future of Statistics. I figured this might be of interest to those that
   are contemplating majoring in Statistics, or considering a career in
   Data Science.

   Q1: Why did you decide to pursue a major in statistics in college?

   A: “When I was a kid, I really enjoyed looking at graphs, plots and
   maps. My parents and I could not make of what was behind the interest.
   At the same time, I was also heavily interested in education. My mother
   was a teacher and the first set of statistics I ever encountered were
   standardized test scores. I strived to understand what the scores
   attempted to say about me, and why such scores and tests are so
   trustworthy. When the stakes increased with the AP and SAT exams, I
   began reading articles published by the Educational Testing Service and
   learned a ton about how these tests are constructed to minimize bias,
   and how scores are comparable across forms. It fascinated me how much
   science goes into these tests, but in the end of the day they are still
   just one factor […]

[74]“Hold Only That Pair of 2s?” Studying a Video Poker Hand with R

   Whenever I tell people in my family that I study Statistics, one of the
   first questions I get from laypeople is “do you count cards?” A blank
   look comes over their face when I say “no.”

   Look, if I am at a casino, I am well aware that the odds are against
   me, so why even try to think that I can use statistics to make money in
   this way? Although I love numbers and math, the stuff flows through my
   brain all day long (and night long), every day. If the goal is to enjoy
   and have fun, I do not want to sit there crunching probability formulas
   in my head (yes that’s fun, but it is also work). So that leaves me at
   the video Poker machines enjoying the free drinks. Another positive
   about video Poker is that $20 can sometimes last a few hours. So it
   should be no surprise that I do not agree with using Poker to teach
   probability.  Poker is an extremely superficial way to introduce such a
   powerful tool and gives the impression that probability is a way to
   make a quick buck, rather than as an important tool in science and
   society. The only […]
