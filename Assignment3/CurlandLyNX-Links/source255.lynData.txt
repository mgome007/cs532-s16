                               [16]My 15 Minutes

   Filed under: [17]General,[18]Technology— arlen@ 5:21 pm

   So, my guest shot on [19]Ruby Rogues is now in the can. I didn’t do as
   well as I would have liked. Was it nerves, or the 100-degree fever I
   was running at the time? More than likely it was that I simply prepared
   for the wrong discussion.

   It’s nobody’s fault but my own; it’s a wide topic and the narrow bit I
   wanted to talk about soon was left behind as wider topics aired, and
   the discussion ranged farther afield than I had prepared data for. Mea
   Culpa. I did a bad job of preparing myself to guest. It happens. It
   will be neither the first nor the last mistake I make. (At least I hope
   it’s not my last; the day I make my last mistake will be the day I
   die.) You learn from it and move on.

                            [22]Why I Like Mongrels

   Filed under: [23]General,[24]Technology— arlen@ 5:02 pm

   Given the recent [25]BritRuby brew-up and the associated wailing and
   gnashing of teeth, I think it’s appropriate to put my own thoughts
   forward on this topic. While I’ve not organized a technical conference
   (yet) I’ve been the sole organizer of chess events catering to areas
   spanning a single city up to a full hemisphere, and been part of groups
   organizing literary conferences, so perhaps I have a little to
   contribute to the public post-mortem currently going on.

   Let me start out with a simple fact: I’m a dog-lover, and I prefer
   mongrels. Pure-bred dogs (and my first dog was a pure Collie, so I’m
   speaking from some experience) come with issues. They can be nervous,
   even neurotic. Quick to anger (or hide). Prone to various diseases and
   birth defects.

   Most of these issues don’t show up in mongrels. The mongrels I’ve owned
   were stable, loving and useful pets. They weren’t nervy, rarely got
   sick. The hardiness comes from the genes of one breed canceling out the
   weaknesses in the genes of another. (It’s like metallurgy. You want the
   iron to be stronger, more useful, you mix in some other elements.
   Alloys are the mongrels of metallurgy.)

   So it goes when it comes to conferences. The wider the experience and
   cultural base of the presenters, in general the more they have to offer
   that I haven’t yet seen or learned. Yum.

                         [28]Patterns of Understanding

   Filed under: [29]General,[30]Technology,[31]Web Design— arlen@ 3:41 pm

   I wrote a [32]little while ago about the advisability of teaching
   software patterns to beginning developers as well as experienced ones.
   But it occurs to me there’s reason for doing it that I may not have
   covered completely.

   I’m going to take as my starting point Donald Knuth’s idea that the
   main task in software development is to explain to other developers
   what we want the computer to do, that the primary audience of source
   code is a human, not a machine. That seems obvious enough to not need
   much supporting evidence. Nobody lives forever, no one stays in the
   same job forever; everybody gets replaced, either voluntarily or
   involuntarily.

   While the syntax of the language makes this communication possible, we
   still need a common conceptual base to make it efficient. Even in
   English it’s easy to come away from a single sentence with multiple
   meanings; development languages, with their near-total focus on what
   over why, can be even more adept at hiding meaning.

                     [35]On Chess and Software Development

   Filed under: [36]General,[37]Technology— arlen@ 3:03 pm

   Or, In Defense Of Software Patterns.

   I was listening to [38]Ruby Rogues podcast episode #56 when the
   discussion turned to software patterns, and my teeth started grinding.

   It wasn’t so much about what was said (though there were enough of
   those moments, to be sure) as about what was implied or left unsaid.
   With one exception (to come later) I’m going to leave names out of
   this, simply because I want the discussion to center on the ideas, not
   the personalities. Listen to the podcast, and you’ll be clear enough
   about who said what, if the who of it means that much to you. I’ll just
   say the guest and the rogues are all not short of accomplishments and
   as a group contain very good developers.

   The implication that came out of it, and that was only halfheartedly
   challenged, was that software patterns weren’t useful things to teach
   beginning developers. The statement that made the show notes was “You
   need to feel the pain and understand the pattern before you begin to
   understand when and why to use it and when to deviate.” While the
   statement itself is defensible, it’s really irrelevant to the value of
   software patterns for either experienced or nascent developers. My own
   first reaction was, “So?, What’s your point?” [39]Continue reading →

                     [41]What I Did To The Jasmine Phantom

   Filed under: [42]General,[43]Technology,[44]Web Design— arlen@ 12:14 pm

   Being a continuation of the saga began in [45]Jasmine And The Headless
   Webkit.

   OK, after the last installment I had a working in-browser test runner
   (standalone Jasmine) and a working command-line test runner
   (phantom-jasmine). But they were different files, meaning if anything
   significant changed, I was going to have to duplicate the changes in
   two different testing files. This, while workable short-term, is not an
   acceptable solution.

   So I dug in to the files.
