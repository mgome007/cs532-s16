[3]My Favorite Things for May & June

   [4]Favorite Things For May
   The weather is finally getting warmer and outdoor markets are popping
   up around Boston faster than the flowers! I'm still running around (now
   on purpose) and trying to soak in as much of the spring as possible.

                     [6]1. Neewer // Running Waist Bag

   I typically don't run with a phone. I like being able to run without my
   technological ball and chain. That being said, I recently decided to
   get back into running. To take my mind off how out of shape I felt I
   started listening to podcasts on my iPhone. I am a finicky runner so
   much so that having anything in my hand or on my arm throws me off
   balance. I LOVE this belt from Neewer. I can barely tell its on, it
   holds my phone and my keys and its water resistant. I actually have no
   idea what I look with it on, but the who goal of exercise is to make
   yourself look like a fool in the most exhausting way possible, right?

                  [7][Louis+Armstrong+La+Vie+En+Rose.jpg]
                [8]2. My "La Vie en Rose" Station on Pandora

   I first heard La Vie en Rose when I was watching [9]Sabrina staring
   Audrey Hepburn. The song has been one of my favorite songs ever since.
   The playlist based on this song is one of my favorites to listen to
   when I am lounging on the porch or cooking a fun dinner.  In addition
   to the Louis Armstrong version of La Vie En Rose, there are songs by
   Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald, Bobby Darin and a bunch of non-lyrical
   french songs that I love.

   [10][birkenstock+birks+cork+snadal+thong+gizeh+flor+comfortable+skgiffa
                         rd+hippie+prep+preppy.jpg]
                        [11]3. Birkenstock // Gizeh

   Until about a month ago I thought of Birkenstocks as sandals for
   hippies and people with foot problems. I was right! But I finally tried
   them on and they are rarely off my feet. These are actually kind of
   cute and stylish. Do your feet a favor and ditch your normal pavement
   slappers for these cork cruisers. If anyone pokes fun, just tell them I
   made you do it.

   [12][cusinart+blender+pink+smoothies+healthy+fruit+kale+spinach+togo+cu
                              p+skgiffard.jpg]
                [13]4. Cusinart // CPB-300PK Compact Blender

   I am not a very healthy eater. I'm not a huge fan of vegetables, and
   while I'll eat fruit if it's cut up and prepared, I'd rather snack on
   carbs in almost any form. Enter this blender. I have been drinking a
   banana a serving of fruit and kale/spinach every day for the last month
   or so. These individual cups with lids (lids set them apart) are the
   perfect vehicles for sneaking the greens into my smoothie is perfect.
   Sometimes I even throw them into milkshakes. I've also started adding
   ground up flax seeds which are not only a good source of omega-3 fatty
   acids, but also provide another way in which I'm turning into my
   mother.

   [14][baggu+resusable+tote+bag+grocery+hot+pink+neon+ecofriendly+environ
                      ment+prep+preppy+skgiffard.jpg]
                    [15]5. Baggu // Standard in Hot Pink

   I have been carrying reusable bags to the grocery store since I was in
   college. They carry more than the average grocery bag and are
   environmentally friendly as well. I like this fold up bag from Baggu
   because it doesn't take up a lot of space in my work tote, but it's
   always there in case I need to grab some groceries on the way home.

[18]I Think I Might Have Been in Shape Once, But I Can't Seem To Remember
When...

   I was a lifelong athlete, until I graduated college. Growing up I can
   hardly remember an afternoon that wasn't filled with soccer practices,
   pool time or laps around the track. I was a high jumper for my first
   two years of college at Bryant University. I chose not to do track when
   I transferred to Auburn, but I had no idea what to do with all my free
   time now that I no longer had hours of track practices. I ended up
   repeating my summer workouts after my classes to occupy that space,
   crazy I know.
   I'm not like that anymore. Working out seems like a chore that takes
   too much time. And going to the gym is a waste of money and they are
   all crowded etc. etc. etc. Here is where the magic of YouTube comes in
   because there are 1000s of work out videos that are fun, free and fast.
   Below are my two of my favorite instructors:
   [19]Lauren Hefez

                           [20]from her Instagram
                           [21]from her Instagram

   I think I found Lauren's YouTube videos through Buzzfeed. Her workouts
   are extremely effective (I had a hard time climbing my stairs after
   her[22] booty shorts workout) and can be done in a small space. She has
   work outs for both cardio and for muscle building.
   [23]Tara Stiles

                [24][914342_855800871103649_739057404_n.jpg]
                           [25]from her Instagram

   Tara Stiles has yoga for every situation. From [26]hip opening
   sequences to yoga for [27]hotels and [28]hangovers. I like her videos
   because she makes yoga accessible, if you aren't as in shape as you'd
   like to be. I will usually string a few of her videos together and end
   with her [29]ultimate stretch yoga routine because deep down inside I
   still want to be able to do splits like Shannon Miller.

[32]My Favorite Movies After a Long Week

   Whenever I've had a really long and exhausting week I like to curl up
   in bed and put on one of these movies. They are not mentally taxing and
   they all feature strong female leads juggling the different aspects of
   their lives. Even though they are movies and real life isn't a movie
   blah, blah, blah, they give me a little hope that I can keep everything
   together.
   [33][Barefoot+In+The+Park+Jane+Fona+Robert+Redford+New+York+Preppy+Prep
   .jpg]
   Jane Fonda and a extremely preppy Robert Redford take on marriage and
   the New York Housing Market
   [34][crazy+stupid+love+steve+carrell+emma+stone+ryan+gosling+comedy+jul
   ianne+moore.jpg]
   Great actors and well written lines that actually hold some truth. Also
   Ryan Gossling's abs if you're into that sort of thing.
   [35][the+holiday+cameron+diaz+jack+black+kate+hudson+jude+law+england+l
   a+.jpg]
   New places, new loves. Directed by Nancy Meyers and Scored by Hans
   Zimmer, who both do an amazing job.
   [36][its+complicated+maryl+streep+alec+baldwin+steve+martin.jpg]
   I love Meryl. She is a goddess. Also written  and directed by Nancy
   Meyers with music by Hans Zimmer. [37]Nancy Meyers  can do a rom-com
   like no other.
   [38][how+to+marry+a+millionaire+marylin+monroe+betty+grable+lauren+baca
   ll.jpg]
   Marylin Monroe, Betty Grable and Lauren Bacall on the hunt for
   billionaires. I like that part of this movie is set in Maine, because
   who doesn't love Maine? [39]On Netflix!
   [40][roman+holiday+audrey+hepburn+robert+peck.jpg]
   Audrey Hepburn as a princess experiencing "normal" life in Rome with
   Gregory Peck. I wish that was my "normal" life. [41]On Netflix!
   [42][sweet+home+alabama+dixie+reese+witherspoon+southern+prep.jpg]
    Reese Witherspoon doing that whole southern thang. Having lived in
   Alabama during college, this movie makes me a tad bit homesick.

[45]My Rainboot Picks for This Spring

   [46]Running Through the Rain
   Don't let the rain get you down! Here are four styles of rain boots to
   keep you dry this spring.
   CITY

                 [47]Hunter // Sandhurst Savoy Riding Boots
                  [48]Hunter // Sandhurst Savoy Riding Boot

   These boots are more polished than the original Hunter Boots, but a
   little more delicate than the original. None the less, the glossy
   finish and faux-quilting make these perfect for wearing around the
   city.
   COUNTRY

    [49][bogs+classic+glosh+rain+boot+green+prep+preppy+farm+country.jpg]
                      [50]Bogs // Classic Glosh Rainboot

   If you will be mucking it up at all this spring I definitely recommend
   Bogs. They are easy to put on and actually have treads which will offer
   some traction on slippery surfaces.
   CASUAL

      [51][Joules+Evedon+bow+welly+rain+boot+prep+preppy+navy+red.jpg]
                   [52]Joules // Evedon Women's Bow Welly

   I kept seeing these boots all over Pinterest and I'm so glad I finally
   found them! They have an adorable grosgrain bow on the back and a nice
   shape. On top of that they have a one year warranty.
   CLASSIC

   [53][bean+boot+llbean+prep+preppy+duck+book+gumshoe+maine+classic.jpg]
                        [54]L.L.Bean //  8" Bean Boot

   In my mind these are the classic rain boot. In fact they are the
   classic every boot. I find that Bean boots are easy to throw on and not
   as hot as traditional rainboot styles.

[57]Desperately seeking Seersucker

   It's finally here! If you live in the South, seersucker season has
   arrived. Those who live north of Dixie can break out those lovely
   stripes, but I prefer to keep my seersucker in storage until Memorial
   day. If you wear your stripes too early you risk getting it spattered
   with mud, muck and whatever winter wetness is still lingering around.
   [58]
   Seersucker Sampler

   [59][cotton+snaps+seersucker+croakies+retainer+sunglasses+prep+preppy+f
                       rat+fratty+southern+south.jpg]
             [60]1. Cotton Snaps // Seersucker Sunglasses Straps

   I have a few pairs of sunglasses straps (croakies) from my time in the
   south. I normally wear my sunglasses on my head, but some sunglasses
   have a nose piece that gets caught in my hair. These straps are perfect
   solution for those glasses and any pair you don't want to lose
   overboard.

        [61][jcrew+J+crew+seersucker+bikini+prep+preppy+orange.png]
     [62]2. J. Crew // Seersucker Demi Underwire Top & Seersucker Bikini
                                   Bottom

   This is such a cute bikini. It's part of an entire seersucker swim
   collection from J. Crew that includes one-piece, tankini and bikini
   options.
   [63][seersucker+modcloth+prep+preppy+dress+bow+white+cross+rush+graduat
   ion+wedding.jpg]
   [64]3. Modcloth // Give Me Amour Dress in Cloud
   White on white seersucker is one of my absolute favorites. This dress
   (I think it's by Jessica Simpson) would be flattering on many body
   types. The sweetheart neckline is created by a faux-wrap front that
   ties in a bow on the back of the dress.

   [65][jcrew+j+crew+seersucker+shorts+colorblock+purple+lilac+prep+preppy
                                   +.jpg]
                [66]4. J. Crew // Colorblock Seersucker Short

   These shorts offer a variation on the traditional seersucker by
   colorblocking lilac and dark purple seersucker fabrics.

   [67][lilly+pulitzer+seers+sucker+scallop+scalloping+skort+green+january
                          +prep+preppy+girly.jpg]
             [68]5. Lilly Pulitzer // January Scallop Hem Skort

   Lilly Pulitzer is the queen of classic preppy style with a twist. This
   skort would be a winner with a straight hem, but the scalloped hem adds
   the crown. And it has pockets!

      [69][sperry+seersucker+bahama+2+eye+tan+boatshoe+prep+preppy.jpg]
                   [70]6. Sperry // Seersucker Bahama 2-Eye

   Sperrys have been a summertime staple for generations. This tan
   seersucker pairs well with jeans and will only help your tan when you
   wear them with shorts!

    [71][greg+norman+seersucker+hat+baseball+prep+preppy+golf+yellow.png]
             [72]7. Greg Norman // Women's Seersucker Crestin Cap

   This would make a great summer hat! The bright color and the
   lightweight seersucker fabric will keep you cool at the beach or just
   running errands.

[75]My Favorite Things for April

   [76]April Showers My April has been a whirlwind so far! New
   opportunities are popping up like daises, and I have been running
   around like a chicken with its head cut off. On top of that I'm
   transitioning my closet from winter to summer. Here are my favorite
   things, both old and new for April.

   [77][JCrew+ballet+flat+royal+blue+preppy+prep+comfortable+classic+class
                             y+affordable.jpg]
                     [78]1. J. Crew // Anya Ballet Flat

   These flats are so comfortable! They actually have a sole, unlike many
   other flats I own, so they offer more support. I bought my first pair
   at J. Crew Factory last spring and they are so affordable I can't wait
   to add another pair to my collection.

   [79][jcrew+j+crew+skgiffard+chambray+denim+shirt+classic+preppy+prep+pr
              epster+spring+summer+style+fashion+america.jpg]
                 [80]2. J. Crew // Two Pocket Chambray Shirt

   At the same time I purchased my Anya flats I also bought this chambray
   shirt. At first I wan't sure what to wear it with, but I found that I
   ended up with colored denim, chino shorts, skirts, leggings etc. If you
   don't own a chambray or denim shirt I highly recommend picking one up
   this spring! There are cuts and washes for everyone.

   [81][yurbuds+skgiffard+bostonstrong+boston+strong+baa+boston+marathon+r
   oyal+blue+yellow+617+one+fund+running+our+city+boylston+copley+waterpro
                           of+sweat+bstrong.jpg]
                  [82]3. Yurbuds // Boston Special Edition

   Yurbuds are great headphones for running or just everyday. In support
   of the survivors of the events at the 2013 Boston Marathon, they are
   donating 10% of the proceeds from their Boston Special edition
   headphones to the [83]Challenged Athletes Foundation, a non-profit
   organization that has been helping those injured in the 2013 Boston
   Marathon bombings [84]"through events, run clinics, grants for adaptive
   equipment."

   [85][mission+blister+armour+feet+new+shoes+skgiffard+useful+blister+blo
   ck+save+your+feet+rubbing+ballet+flats+sandals+runing+shoes+athlete.jpg
                                     ]
                      [86]4. Mission // Blister Armour

   New shoes sometimes mean new blisters. I have terrible feet, probably
   from years of sport. I find that Mission Blister Armour prevents them
   especially on my heels. If I do get a blister, putting a little of this
   on top of the bandaid keeps the shoe from catching on it.

   [87][essie+butler+please+prep+preppy+royal+blue+marathon+blue+classic+t
                an+toes+fingers+classic+perfect+polish.jpg]
                        [88]5. Essie // Butler Please

   I love to wear this color in the summer when I'm tan. Its a bright,
   warm royal blue that can be edgy or preppy. It is on my toes right now!
   I can't wait to try it out with a matte top coat.
