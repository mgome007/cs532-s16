   At Collina Italiana (CI), we offer Italian language and culture
   programs both on- and off-site. Lovers of Italian language and culture
   soon discover that CI classes offer a unique opportunity for a
   comprehensive learning experience without leaving the city.

   trains at 86th Street), our language and cultural center is known for
   offering Italian classes in a contemporary setting, including workshops
   in both Italian wine and books. Depending on the time of your class,
   you’ll be served either cappuccino or sparkling Prosecco while learning
   the bella lingua and the bella vita of Italy.

   We offer year-round [32]group and private lessons, [33]tutoring
   services, [34]specialty classes for adults and [35]children’s
   programming, such as [36]Teatro Italiano and Make an Italian Show:
   language through drama classes where children can bring their stories
   on stage. For adults our [37]Language Intensive Workshop, an intensive
   language and culture program, prepares you in Italiano for both
   business and pleasure. Registration for adult and children’s groups and
   individual classes is ongoing.

   Collina Italiana director, Patrizia Saglio, welcomes you to a unique
   language program in an authentic Italian setting in which you’ll learn
   the Italian spoken today and discover the contemporary culture of Italy
   through the culinary arts, wine, film, lectures, conversation, outings,
