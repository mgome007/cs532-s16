[138]How actress’ partner found out about her infidelity

   Posted by adamondrock on February 19th, 2016

   [139]bwright

   Bukky Wright sheds light on new movie and her son’s music career

   Nollywood actress Bukky Wright says her new movie is almost ready.
   Speaking exclusively to Hip TV, she said the film which was shot in the
   United States is in its final stage, specifically the post-production
   phase.

   The movie is titled Beast Amongst Us and promises a number of
   international appearances. It is the story of a couple who struggle to
   salvage their relationship owing to a number of factors. First, the
   wife accusses the husband of his inability to satisfy her in some
   respects.
   Then the husband goes ahead and accuses the wife of being unfaithful to
   him, an allegation she denies swiftly until there is a major discovery
   and everything turns around.

   The suspense following this is many shades of interesting and a joy to
   watch. Other than the new movie,
   Bukky also decried the spate of image abuse actors suffer in Nigeria as
   a result of misconceptions from the public. She listed this as a major
   setback for the image of actors in the movie industry.

   She added that most of these acts are make-believe and so should not be
   taken seriously by viewers when they go about criticizing entertainers.
   On her son’s career, she expressed readiness to support him to the
   fullest in his music career.

   See the Hip TV interview clip below:

   IFRAME: [140]https://www.youtube.com/embed/4_t4fHvA4cU

   Bukky Wright is a seasoned Nollywood actress who has been in the movie
   industry for some time, earning her stripes in acting, production and
   related media activities. She is also a business woman with several
   personal investments outside Nollywood.

[171]Iyanya discloses plans to settle down, refuses to make affair public

   Posted by adamondrock on February 19th, 2016

   [172]iyanya1
   Afro Pop star Iyanya has disclosed plans to settle down with a woman
   this year, but he has no plans of making the relationship public. He
   made this known during a recent chat with Punch, stating that he will
   not miss being single when he eventually ties the knot.

   The 29-year-old singer said: “I am making plans to do all that but I
   don’t think I would want people to know anything about it. I will not
   miss the single life.”
   The Kukere singer held that a relationship that makes it way into
   public view has every tendency to fail as a result of undue attention
   and pressure. He said: “The truth is that once it gets to the hands of
   the media, we both lose it. But it is not your fault because you are
   just doing your job. But then, it just takes a negative effect on the
   relationship.
   “It puts us on unnecessary pressure. It gives the people who don’t even
   have the right to talk, an opportunity to interfere even when they
   don’t know the truth about what is going on. “So from social media,
   I’ve learnt to keep my relationship private and to give the people more
   music. That is what they know me for first of all. I don’t let the
   other things cloud the music that I’m known for.”

   The singer is obviously talking from experience given his previous
   relationships which were big in media. In the past, he went out with
   top Ghanaian actress and celebrity Yvonne Nelson but they split before
   long.
   In 2015, the Triple MG singer was rumoured to be in a relationship with
   socialite Freda Francis, the chief executive of Global Orchard Service
   and Oasis Med Spa. By August 2015, the speculations were put to bed
   after the singer shared online a picture of them cuddling. Afterwards,
   Freda was spotted at his Abuja album launch and a couple of other
   events where he was present.

[209]Beverley Osu’s Failing Attempt To Be Nigerian Kim Kardashian In Photos

   Posted by adamondrock on February 19th, 2016

   [210]bo
   The former BBA contestant, Beverly Osu, has been making frantic efforts
   to be dubbed Nigerian version of Hollywood star, Kim Kardashian.

   The controversial actress and reality show star took some nearly unclad
   photos which she tagged ‘Sad Post-Valentine’.

   The Ebonyi State born star also has a story of how she spent a lonely
   Valentine’s Day as her ‘Johnny’ stood her up.

   “Don’t tell me you care about me unless you mean it, because I might do
   something crazy and believe it.

   ?shh…listen don’t you hear I’m crying but they are silent tears I’m
   crying on the inside so you can’t see all the pain running though me I
   cry for you ,I cry for the times I can’t. ?I am still here because i’m
   afraid of being lonely but what difference does it make? Johnny what
   excuse do you have for not showing up on Valentine’s Day? I waited, I
   accepted, I checked my phones, Nepa took the light, I still waited
   Johnny, I changed twice because I was unsure of? how to look for
   you…everything became unsure, I even became unsure of my principles,”
   she wrote.

[228]Reason Why Kate Henshaw Calls Her Fan Chimpanzee

   Posted by adamondrock on February 19th, 2016

   [229]k81
   The attitude of some fans could be frustrating sometimes, they pick on
   some celebrities and say awful things, forgetting the fact that they
   are also humans and they have feelings too.

   The question that keeps coming to mind is, why are you following
   someone you do not like their personality, instead of insulting an
   individual, you can as well unfollow that person.

   Recently, Nollywood star actress, Kate Henshaw was a victim of online
   bully, as a fan insulted her by calling her ugly after she uploaded a
   photo.

   The actress also got no chill as she immediately responded by calling
   him a chimpanzee.
   ‘‘ chimpanzee escaped from zoo, that’s what you are… will inform the
   zookeeper that one of it’s animal escaped.’’ she wrote.

   The actress further said she would not ignore anyone who insults her,
   as no one has the right to insult, and she is no one’s easy target, who
   ever tries to insult or laugh at her would get more than what they
   expect.

[244]5 ways a break up could help P-Square, Jude Okoye

   Posted by adamondrock on February 18th, 2016

   [245]peter
   The recent issue between Peter, Paul and Jude Okoye will look like a PR
   stunt if they eventually make up, which is already very likely with
   Peter’s recent post on Instagram wherein he made an obvious statement
   about apology. But beyond that, an actual break up will be good for all
   parties involved and there are a number of points that prove this.

   Looking at the current situation, if the Okoye brothers are indeed ‘PR
   stunting’, then the benefits are numerous. For starters, they will
   remain in the headlines for some time as a result, and anything they
   get involved in will enjoy prime time in the media. This is always the
   case when celebrities clash. Fans and critics take sides, critique and
   then observe happenings in the weeks and months leading up to any major
   album release or anything else the celebrities are handling.

   But regardless of celebrities riding on the back of controversies into
   further prominence and commercial gains, one party will always be on
   the losing end when all has been said and done. It is always a ‘David
   and Goliath’ tussle, with one party suffering defeat or an outright
   career harm in some situations.

   [246]peterpq

   This is fact and history has shown this over and over. Given this, many
   have taken a deeper look at the current tussle between Peter, Paul and
   Jude Okoye and are coming up with series of conclusions on who stands
   to gain more from the group separating (if that becomes the case).

   As you ponder on this, below are five points we have gathered so far
   from the narrative that prove that a break up could be helpful for the
   Okoye brothers and the Nigerian music industry in general:

   1. The fans are actually bored of the same old stuff and maybe a break
   up will ‘rile up’ each party to outdo the other on the next track,
   mixtape or album if they decide to part ways.

   2. A break up will bring about innovation and fresh ideas. Having
   listened to the sounds from the brothers over the years, a whole new
   type of music vibe from them will not be out of place, maybe a
   digression into other genres like Reggae, Highlife or Hip hop who
   knows? Just anything fresh would do.

   3. The brothers talk too much and so maybe a split is what they
   actually need so the world can see who the real McCoy is. This will
   also help in the aspect of bringing about competition and healthy
   rivalry which are key ingredients for success.

   4. Competition is good for business, very good actually as it helps
   increase profits. Whatever the case, this public face off between the
   brothers help will help shoot up record sales and boost whatever
   personal involvements they have going on if they decide to do music
   separately.

   It will also spill over into the corporate clients whose brands they
   currently represent by bringing more attention to the entire process.
   And as we said here during the Olamide-Don Jazzy issue, drama is good
   for business because like bacteria they are important too.

   5. Competition from the break up will help shake off complacency which
   P-Square appear to be suffering from. What do you think?

[260]Instagram Comedian ‘Twyse_116’ In Suicidal Series Of Tweets

   Posted by adamondrock on February 18th, 2016

   [261]Twyse-116-400x400
   A Nigerian Instagram comedian, known as ‘Tyse_116’ has taken to Twitter
   and appears to be considering suicide going by his series of Tweets.

   After a series of Tweets expressing his frustration, he tweeted these

   By if I cld find a gun, I’ll just shoot my brains out and forget I ever
   existed. Life is really meaningless to me right now.

   — EREME (@twyse_116) February 18, 2016

   Too late. Fuck everything. I won’t be making any more videos frm now
   henceforth I’m sorry. Thanks to everyone who ever supported n stood

   — EREME (@twyse_116) February 18, 2016

   By me, u are d only family I’ve got thts why I cherish u way more than
   u cld ever imagine. This wld be my last words n I’m gone for good.

   — EREME (@twyse_116) February 18, 2016

   Dreams do come true, mine just seems like an impossibility . I’m sorry
   Mom ??. N most of all my fans out there.

   — EREME (@twyse_116) February 18, 2016

   While we hope it;s not a publicity stunt of sorts, we do implore his
   friends to prevail upon him to consider not taking out his frustrations
   to the extent of committing suicide.

   In a later development a relation or friend of the comedian has
   admitted taking over the Twyse’s account till he gets through his
   situation, and reports that all is clear and no more cause for alarm.

   It’s no news Banky W has just released a new single entitled, All I
   want is you, featuring chidinma.

   Ever since it’s release, it has got people complimenting him for a job
   well done, despite been the producer, writer and director of the song,
   it came out loved by many.

   Chidi Mokeme joined the list of people praising Banky W for his new
   release, and also made a remark that the song reminds him of a slap he
   got from Zack Orji twenty years ago while on set.

   This affirms that some of the slap scenes we see on her screens might
   not be an ordinarily effect but real, as Chidi jokingly said his ears
   are still ringing from the effect of the slap.

[290]Juliet Ibrahim Finds New Love in Hausa Land

   Posted by adamondrock on February 18th, 2016

   [291]juliet
   Ghanaian actress, Juliet Ibrahim, is seriously enjoying her job which
   is acting and this time, the actress has taken it a step further as she
   features in her first Hausa movie, ‘LADAN NOMA.’

   The actress has been penetrating the Nigerian movie industry with full
   force and she does not seems to slow down or allow anything weigh her
   down.

   First, she worked with Mercy Aigbe, on a Yoruba movie, where she was a
   lawyer and she was able to deliver her Yoruba lines well. With the
   success of her role in the movie, she has proven that she can handle
   any role and that has earned her the Hausa movie role.

   Anyway, she looks like and Hausa lady so her beauty best matches the
   genre she is giving a shot at. All thanks to popular Hausa movie
   production outfit, Uzee concept, who decided to engage her services to
   tell the Hausa story.
