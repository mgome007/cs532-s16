[21]Support Request: Asus R9 290 DirectCU II 4GB GDDR5

   [22]31st August 2015 by [23]Joshua·[24]0 Comments

   [25]Asus R9 290 DirectCU II 4GB GDDR5 Since purchasing the Asus R9 290
   DirectCU II 4GB GDDR5 from an online vendor I’ve had nothing but issues
   with the graphics card.

   This is the second R9 290 I’ve had this year will will more than likely
   not be the last as the vendor refuses to give a refund after the first
   28 days – a replacement card will be issued. Here is the ticket I have
   created with the vendor.

[27]Review: Asus R9 290 DirectCU II 4GB GDDR5

   [28]30th August 2015 by [29]Joshua·[30]0 Comments

   Since purchasing the R9 290 back in March 2015, I’ve had nothing but
   issues with it. The first card lasted one month before I started to
   experience blackscreens, overheating and general performance issues.
   After many hours of troubleshooting I decided that the only thing I had
   left was to send the card back for a refund however I was told that I
   was not allowed a refund and a replacement card would be send out
   within 24 hours.

   In the mean time, I decided to do some more research on the card and
   found a large amount of people were experiencing the same problems as
   myself;
    1. “I experienced frequent BSCs (Black Screen Crash) every 20 minutes
       or so during gaming. I followed a lot of ‘advice’ in the forums,
       trying to fix this issue…but to no avail.”
    2. “I got upon release, I kept getting Black Screen crashes from
       roughly 2 to 10 minutes after I boot up. I spent a few hours
       switching drivers and tinkering with settings but still got these
       crashes.”
    3. “Hi guys! I recently bought R9 290, and after few days it start
       Black Screen. I could not enter in any game, the screen freez and
       start Black.”

   Since receiving the second card, it’s been great. The first two months
   the card performed as expected until today – I’ve once again been left
   in the same situation and the card is performing like the last.

[31]Reddit: How do you recover from a screw up and save face

   [32]25th August 2015 by [33]Joshua·[34]0 Comments

   “I’m a junior and bit offs more than I should have. Thankfully it was
   just a stand by of an active standby pair, but the engineer asked me to
   investigate a minor issue and I ran the wrong command. Now I couldn’t
   recover from it and it’s down until I can crawl to the engineer and
   tell him what I did.

   I hope he has a backup config and the rest I can get from the active
   with his help and transfer to the standby, which I plan to offer to do
   in the same sentence as asking for forgiveness. I’m just hoping that’s
   enough to salvage any trust he’ll have for me.

   Vague for reasons. Can anyone share some advice here or share their
   experience so I feel less alone in my terror?” – [35]ACiDGRiM (Source)

[37]Windows 10: Forced Windows updates

   [38]24th August 2015 by [39]Joshua·[40]0 Comments

   The forced updates are by far the trickiest aspect of Windows 10. Yet
   another problem that can occur is when a Windows update coincides with
   a third party driver management software update. This can cause a
   crash. The third party software can be halted, but the Windows update
   cannot. Your best bet is uninstall third party driver management and
   letting Windows take care of all the system updates, which gives
   Microsoft power over another company’s products, which isn’t cool. I
   hope there is a way to stop this happening in the near future.

[41]Windows 7: Import from network to Windows MovieMaker

   [42]24th August 2015 by [43]Joshua·[44]0 Comments

   Ok, this is bizarre – Windows Live MovieMaker won’t let you import
   network files by default. Okay, so they’ll be large and may monopolise
   network traffic for a while, but shouldn’t that be your choice?

   Anyway, a quick Registry tweak will solve this annoying problem. Simply
   run REGEDIT, browse to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows
   Live\Movie Maker, add a DWORD value called AllowNetworkFiles and set it
   to 1: job done.

[46]Windows 7: Standardising the taskbar

   [47]24th August 2015 by [48]Joshua·[49]0 Comments

   We love the Windows 7 taskbar, but many people seem less than impressed
   with the new approach to taskbar buttons, finding it difficult to tell
   at a glance whether an icon is a running application or a pinned
   shortcut. If this sounds like you then there’s an easy way to restore
   more standard taskbar buttons, though – right-click the taskbar, select
   Properties, and set Taskbar Buttons to “Never combine” or “Combine when
   taskbar is full”.

   You can even restore the old Quick Launch toolbar in just a few clicks.
   Simply right-click the taskbar, click Toolbars > New Toolbar, type
   %userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Quick Launch
   in the folder box and click Select Folder. The Quick Launch toolbar
   should then reappear, and you can move and resize it to suit your
   needs.

[50]First Impressions of Kali Linux 2.0

   [51]24th August 2015 by [52]Joshua·[53]0 Comments

   Kali Linux 2.0 was released on August 11  2015. I downloaded 64-bit
   full version and installed it on VMWare. The host computer has Intel i5
   3570k, 8 GB RAM. I assigned 2 GB RAM to Kali Linux 2.0 and it was quite
   quick surprisingly.

   When installing via non-graphic interface, you may encounter no network
   mirror repos, you need to bypass it by selecting “Continue without a
   network mirror? Yes” and we will edit the /etc/apt/sources.list later.
   Graphic interface may also has the same problem too. After the
   installation is completed, we can edit the /etc/apt/sources.list if you
   encountered no mirror repos when install.

[55]Offensive Security Introduces Kali Linux

   [56]21st August 2015 by [57]Joshua·[58]0 Comments

   Black Hat Europe, Amsterdam – March 13 – [59]Offensive Security today
   announced the availability of [60]Kali Linux, the evolution of its
   popular [61]BackTrack Linux, a free security auditing operating system
   and toolkit. Showcased at [62]Black Hat Europe in Amsterdam, Kali Linux
   incorporates more than 300 penetration testing and security auditing
   programs with a Linux operating system, delivering an all-in-one
   solution that enables IT administrators and security professionals to
   test the effectiveness of risk mitigation strategies.

   “For IT professionals, an experiment is worth a thousand theories.
   Applied to security, it means that simulating attacks to assess the
   defenses protecting your organization is the only sure way to
   understand their effectiveness and the impact of an attack,” said Mati
   Aharoni, Lead Trainer and Developer, Offensive Security. “That’s why we
   created Kali Linux; we’ve developed the most advanced penetration
   testing and security auditing toolkit available to help IT
   administrators and security professionals put themselves in the shoes
   of potential attackers.”
