[7]All about Lulzbot, Simplify3D, and 3D Printing

   Welcome to Beep Boop Click, my new site for discussing some of my
   journey in 3D Printing. I've been working with some printers over the
   years, but I've just gotten a [9]LulzBot Mini (Amazon Affiliate Link),
   which is their brand-new model.

   Indeed, it's a new line for them, as Aleph Objects has mostly stuck
   with the Taz line until now. Which is important, because while there's
   a bunch of knowledge out there for the Taz line, the Mini has some cool
   new features like the auto-leveling bed, and it has a new form factor,
   different motherboard, and all the little things that make it harder
   for people to use the information that already exists. So I figured I
   would document what I learn here.

   I'm also using Simplify3D for my slicing, which means transferring all
   the existing profiles for [10]Cura into [11]Simplify3D and learning
   what sorts of cool things I can do with that for a better slicing
   experience. As I create those profiles, I'll go ahead and put them in a
   convenient location on the site. Hopefully I can give people a better
   idea of if Simplify3D is worth the $150 (it is for me, and probably is
   for you) as there's no free trial, so it's a big leap to go from the
   Free/Open Source tools to something like that.

   Of course, when I make 3D models, I will share them on various sites
   and talk about them here.

   Finally, as of when I purchased, just about the only videos that I
   could find for the LulzBot Mini were printing out the [12]Rocktopus, so
   I think it would be worthwhile adding a bunch of videos as well.

   So welcome again, and let's see what sorts of trouble we can get into
   with 3D Printing, shall we?

   [15]Matthew Meyer. Though obviously more of a blue bear here.
