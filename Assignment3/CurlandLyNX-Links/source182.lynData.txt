   Let's work together to make you a website that is innovative,
   professional, creative and fun! I love working with clients to discover
   their company's unique heartbeat and using that to inform the way we
   build their site.

   Simply saying something is not enough. The way we present your content
   will change the way your customers and followers interact with it and
   will change the meaning of your message. Form and content follow each
   other in a beautiful circle.
     * I love putting a frame around life and calling it art.
     * I believe you have to start with what you have from where you are.
     * I am committed to creating things that are beautiful, exciting and
       socially aware.

What.

These are the skills that I use to get the results that you want.

     * HTML5
     * CSS3
     * javascript
     * jquery
     * Sass
     * Wordpress
     * github
     * gulp

Where.

Get in touch.
