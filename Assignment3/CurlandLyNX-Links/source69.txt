                I just finished reading The Hard Thing About Hard Things by Ben Horowitz. As technology management books go it&#8217;s by far the most refreshing, honest and illuminating thing I have read in years. I strongly recommend buying the book. The profits go to a good cause too. I didn&#8217;t know much about Ben Horowitz, other than an awareness that he&#8217;s half of the VC power duo Andreessen-Horowitz, but he clearly deserves all the plaudits he gets. Plus he&#8217;s likes rap music and, in additio

                Software projects cost a lot of money. Some of them stretch to sums that would have made Howard Hughes cry like a two-year-old being babysat by Marilyn Manson. It&#8217;s lucky that so many are funded by big companies and government institutions with deep, continuously-filled, pockets because otherwise nothing would ever get finished. Yet a lot of very good software is also cheap, even free. Part of the reason projects are expensive is because businesses view software in all the wrong ways and pa

                When I was seventeen I bought a stack of Lou Reed records. I didn&#8217;t really know that much about Lou Reed but there was this girl. And she really liked him. And I really liked her. So I needed to get into Lou Reed quickly. I started where everyone starts with Lou reed - the 1972 classic Transformer) - by any standards an impeccable piece of work with its heady mix of brash sexual metaphors and delicate vocals. Then I explored forwards through his catalogue and backwards into Velvet Undergrou

                Anyone who&#8217;s soaked their head in agile techniques for a while can&#8217;t help but become a little obsessed by the concept of &#8221;lean&#8221;. Behind all the fine words they&#8217;re essentially the same thing - a quest to discover ways of delivering with the minimum amount of waste: stand-ups instead of meetings, cards instead of documentation, conversations instead of process, value instead of activities.

                You can&#8217;t go to a conference, read a blog (ahem) or open a tech mag without someone talking about Big Data these days. Now I&#8217;m as excited the next person whenever new techniques, approaches, tools, frameworks, whatever come along, but equally, given our industry&#8217;s penchant for hype, it&#8217;s important to keep one eye out for denuded emperors keen to show off their new wardrobe or vendors with sales targets to hit.

                Google&#8217;s code of conduct begins with the phrase &#8220;Don&#8217;t be evil&#8221;. If you work for, or with, Google you&#8217;re meant to follow the code. Google&#8217;s management enforce the code to the extent that you&#8217;re even protected from retaliation if you blow the whistle on someone who is being evil.

I have a pet peeve with codes of conduct, missions statements, HR policies and (my favourite) architectural principles. They nearly always state the bleeding obvious as if it&#82

                I &#8216;ve talked, rather a lot, about my views on the use of open source software in the big fat corporate enterprise. Because these rambles have been at conferences or in occasional blog posts, the pitch has been aimed at enterprise developers:


Use open-source where you can, but do not think of it simply as a &#8220;free&#8221; resource; give something back to community through promoting it, patching it, extending it and paying for support.


Everyone wins.

The argument is partly idealistic

They are forced to do their job using a tool implemented by The Project some years ago. The Tool was an over-complex inappropriate hulk when it was selected. The Tool is made by The Big Vendor. We&#8217;ve all heard of The Big Vendor. They market The Tool to many industry segments and have a specialist pre-sales team for each segment. The Tool was very expensive.

                Welcome to part two. Last time we looked at the experience of getting a NoSQL product accepted in an enterprise environment. Assuming you got through that, the next step is to do something useful with it. Like any tool, you will only get good stuff out if you know how make the best of it. In this case that means not treating it too much like a relational database and understanding the internal nuances.

For our particular set of requirements we chose MongoDB. We tried Oracle first but either the

                Time flies - it was nearly two years ago that I wrote &#8217;Strained Relationships&#8217;, an article extolling the potential benefits of NoSQL data stores. My main point then, and now, was that certain features of the new wave of non-relational products looked a promising solution (in part) to improving speed-of-change in large enterprises. Sadly, too many articles in the NoSQL space still focus their attention on drooling fanboi speed and whilst it&#8217;s true that NoSQL products are generall
