   [4]Speak with a Human
   The Hybrid Group will be your partner to make you happy with our
   hard-won skills in
   Web Development, Design, User Experience, and Hardware Integration.

Who We've Helped

   You may not know it, but you've likely seen our work. We're proud to
   labor behind the scenes
   with some of the best and brightest in the business.

     The Hybrid Group writes text-book code. It's clean, well-tested, and
     we learned a lot from their code structure. They also produced some
     really cool open source projects using Pebble."

     - Benjamin Bryant, Web and Ecommerce,
     [5][icon-pebble.png] Pebble

     The Hybrid Group is crazy fast. They got their software integration
     working with our hardware before we got our own software working
     with our hardware. True story."

     - Zach Supalla, CEO & Co-Founder,
     [6][icon-spark.png] Spark

     We had built a working app, but needed expert development to help
     refine it. The Hybrid Group delivered. And even with an in-house
     team, we still call on them whenever we need the extra leverage of
     specialized knowledge or to push a deadline."

     – Eric M. Jackson, CEO and Co-Founder,
     [7][icon-caplinked.png] CapLinked

     The Hybrid Group has been a valuable partner that we've grown to
     trust and I look forward to working with them more. They have a deep
     knowledge of hardware and software that is unmatched. They get it."

     - Ross Ingram, Community Manager,
     [8][icon-orbotix.png] Orbotix

     One of the best business decisions I have ever made was selecting
     The Hybrid Group to build our web community. Not only did The Hybrid
     Group do what we asked from them, they were always one step ahead.
     The team is first rate and the comfort of knowing they have our back
     is priceless."

     - David Codr, CEO/Founder,
     [9][icon-musicpage.png] Musicpage

     The Hybrid Group helped us hit a seemingly impossible deadline.
     Usually quality is a tradeoff for speed but with The Hybrid Group
     you get both."
