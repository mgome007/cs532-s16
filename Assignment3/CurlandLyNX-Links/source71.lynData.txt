[13]I Need Me Some Creative Viagra

   [14]February 9, 2016[15]Extreme Sarcasm[16]blogs about nothing[17]The
   Olive Gal

   It’s been a little quiet here at The Olive Gal lately. And for no good
   reason. I told myself when I started this blog more than two years ago
   that I wouldn’t just crank out blogs to have blogs. I’d write when I
   had something to write about.

   So yeah, about that…

   It’s not that there hasn’t been stuff happening in my life. Quite the
   contrary. Maybe it’s not groundbreaking, earth-shattering stuff, but I
   can usually find something to reflect on. Oh hey, I got a hang nail!
   What’s the symbology??

   It’s not that there haven’t been juicy socio-political-cultural things
   to satirize. In fact, on Thursday I got all mad and frothy at a [18]USA
   Today article that explained how the CDC believes all women of
   child-bearing age should avoid alcohol. (You have a uterus? Does it
   work yet? NO DRINKING FOR YOU!)

   But man. I just can’t get it up lately.
   Help, I'm in a nutshell. Help, I’m in a nutshell.

   I spend my days writing and researching and strategizing and worrying
   about SEO. I ain’t complaining about that. I spend a good part of my
   time as a virtual car recluse, confined to the four walls of my
   crossover while I crumple-faced cry-sing my way through Sara Bareilles’
   “Gravity” for the 15th time in a row.

   I spend my evenings as the Qasimodo-esque servant to a five-year-old
   tyrant, who’s practically telling me to “mush” as we piggyback down the
   hallway to the bathroom (because he refuses to walk there on his own),
   and whose nightly wake-up calls have gotten me daydreaming about dying
   just so I can have seven straight hours of rest.

   So when I do find myself alone on the couch these days, I heave a sigh
   and reach for my laptop. Upon seeing the login screen, I decide I don’t
   have the energy to type in my password and give up. If that’s not a
   parallel for middle-aged flaccidity, I don’t know what is.

   So here we are. Me in desperate need of inspiration, and you going “Why
   the hell am I still reading this bullshit?”

   If there were a pill called Creative Viagra, I’d be loading up on it
   like a rich, privileged pharma-junkie just treading water between
   scores. Since there isn’t, I’ll have to settle for that Elvis-lite
   lyfe: hyper-caffeinating during the day and knocking myself out with
   ZzzQuil at night.

   I’m not sure how to end this blog. How did Larry David end Seinfeld, a
   show about nothing? Terribly. They went to jail, like a bunch of
   assholes. Is there a blog jail? Maybe I need to go there. For
   inspiration.

   The end.

[26]Beautiful Boy

   [27]January 25, 2016[28]Family[29]big boy, [30]five years old,
   [31]happy birthday lucas[32]The Olive Gal

   It’s your 5th birthday today. A pretty big deal. Five years ago, you
   came into this world and you changed everything.

   So much can happen in five years. Five years before you came, I hadn’t
   met your dad. I was living in New York, and the last thing I was
   thinking about was being a mom.

   Now I can tell you that the best thing I’ve done in the last five years
   is you.

   In fact, the best thing I’ve done in my whole life is you. And I assure
   you, there’s nothing else I can do that will be better.

   baby

   But I can’t take credit anymore, Lucas. Because in five short years,
   you’ve done so much on your own. You’ve smiled, discovered your hands
   and feet, crawled, walked, ran, talked, questioned, yelled, drawn,
   written, hugged, held hands, made friends, played, created,
   learned, loved.

   When my back was in pain and I laid on the ground, you crawled over to
   me and put your hand on my face.

   When your friend Stephen got hurt at school, you sat with him all day
   and made sure he was alright.

   When I picked you up at daycare, you ran at me full force and nearly
   knocked me over. Every day.

   redsoxlucas

   When you were two years old, you discovered you loved lights and things
   that spin. Now you’re building circuits and amassing a strange and
   wonderful collection of fans.

   You laugh easily, and your laugh makes everyone else laugh. Your smile
   brightens the room. You power our family like the sun, and you warm all
   those around you.

   That’s the kind of beautiful boy you are, Lucas.

   happylucas

   These past five years with you have been nothing short of magical. I
   look at you and can’t believe there was ever a time before you.

   This precious, precious time with you. It’s going by quickly. I never
   wanted to live forever until the day you were born. Then I looked at
   you and thought: I can never leave you. I know someday, someday before
   I even know it, you’ll strike out on your own. Thirteen more years
   in our home is not enough. Fifty more years on this Earth together (God
   willing) is not enough.

   Eternity wouldn’t be enough.

   But for now, let me just say, I’m so thankful for these five years,
   Lucas. Happy birthday.

[40]The Epic Argument That Almost Ended in Divorce

   [41]January 7, 2016[42]Family[43]28 Days Later ruined my marriage,
   [44]divorce, [45]dumbest argument ever, [46]marriage[47]The Olive Gal

   IMG_6072 Every once in a while in a marriage, you come to a crossroads.
   Should we keep slugging away and work through this thing? Or should we
   just split up?

   During a recent, ridiculous argument, I came thisclose to calling the
   whole thing off. But to understand how I got to that point, I have to
   take you on a little trip through memory lane.

   Once upon a time in a living room in King City, two brothers decided to
   torture their younger brother, whose only crime was asking to go see
   the movie 28 Weeks Later with them. The oldest brother, Alex, told his
   youngest, pre-teen brother, Zamir:

   “You’re a giant pussy, and there’s no way you can sit through this
   movie.”

   Zamir, of course, insisted he was junior-manly enough to handle it. So
   Alex and Ozzy (middle brother) put him to the test. They said that if
   he could grit his way through 28 Days Later, then they’d bring him to
   see the sequel. So they popped in the movie, and a pseudo-confident
   Zamir sat next to them.

   Ten minutes later, Zamir said, “Oh snap! I left something in my room!”
   and disappeared for the rest of the film. Needless to say, the older
   brothers have never let him live it down. It’s a story that gets told
   over, and over, and over, and over at Zamora family gatherings.

   But you guys, here’s the thing: I SWEAR I was there. And Alex insists I
   was not.

   28 Weeks Later came out on May 11, 2007. That was a mere four months
   after I had moved to California, and I knew no one else except Alex and
   his family and friends. If Alex was in King City, so was I.

   But apparently…I wasn’t. We argued and argued and argued, and finally
   Alex called Ozzy for backup. “Nope,” Ozzy said. “She wasn’t there.” I
   still insisted. I can distinctly remember where Zamir was sitting and
   his voice as he said, “Oh snap!”

   Alex checked with Zamir. “Was Wendy there when that happened?” Nope.
   Alex explained that they’ve told the story so many times, I must have
   come to believe I was there in person. I got served. But I remained
   frustrated, and continued to argue my point. Because if I wasn’t there,
   then…

   Where the hell was I?

   And here’s where the epic argument went south. Alex damned himself by
   saying that I DIDN’T EVEN LIVE IN CALIFORNIA at that time. Apparently,
   I’m the one with the shitty memory, but he’s the one who has purged
   entire months of our relationship from his brain.

   Just as I stubbornly insisted that I was there when Zamir tucked tail
   and booked it back into his bedroom, Alex contended that no, I did not
   live in California at the beginning of 2007. His side of the story was
   that I spent the summer of 2007 in Massachusetts looking for jobs and
   THEN moved out west.

   Wrong.

   Left Dance Spirit magazine in January 2006. Moved to California in
   February 2007 (lived with Alex’s friends). MOVED IN WITH ALEX in April
   2007. Went to Massachusetts for the summer to look for jobs. Failed.
   Came back in September 2007 for good.

   I guess I was such a good roommate that he had no idea I was there!

   The argument intensified. I keep pulling up facts and figures and dates
   and specifics, and Alex dug in his heels. Since I had lost so
   spectacularly in the Zamir argument, there was no way I could be
   trusted. My blood was beginning to boil. A miasma of red anger was
   clouding my eyes. I could feel my skin turning to green when I said,
   “Don’t you remember? You proposed to me that summer! Why would you
   propose to someone who had not yet lived in the same state as you?”

   Guys…deep breath…He goes:

   “Oh, I didn’t remember proposing to you then.”

   …

   ……

   ………

   …………..

   ………………….

   What the will-you-marry-me fuck?!?!

   The natural, level-headed reaction to that from me was, “Fine! I never
   lived in California in 2007! You never loved me! And we should just get
   a divorce!”

   Thankfully, this was so absurd that Alex just started cracking up, and
   so did I. But in seven years of marriage, that’s the first time the
   D-word has escaped my lips.

   Problem is, I have opened a can of worms. Because now, in true Zamora
   fashion, he will lord this over me for the rest of our lives. For
   example, a recent Twitter conversation:

   Screen Shot 2016-01-07 at 8.14.32 PM Screen Shot 2016-01-07 at 8.16.28
   PM

   And I can’t take it. Divorce may be the only way to escape.

[55]Word of the Year: Balance

   [56]January 3, 2016[57]Extreme Sarcasm[58]balance, [59]lame car
   metaphors, [60]New Year's resolution[61]The Olive Gal

   Every New Year, us humans have an innate tendency to reflect on the 365
   days we survived and look ahead to the 365 to come. We can’t help it,
   it’s a [62]thing we do. (And me especially. This annual tradition falls
   right into the lap of my navel-gazing wheelhouse.) After reflecting and
   checking boxes for accomplishments and contemplating tasks left
   incomplete, we resolve to forge ahead. Some of us wish for change. Some
   of us want to keep momentum going. Some of us plainly don’t give a
   shit.

   [63]But I do. And as I think ahead to my 36th year, I search for a path
   that can bring me and my family happiness and prosperity. In some
   years, I’ve dug my heels in with renewed tenacity, looking to pursue
   missed goals or creating new ones to reach. Sometimes that’s worked.
   Other times, it’s been [64]a miserable failure.

   This year, I’m trying a different approach.

   2015 was a year of transitions: selling the house, getting laid off,
   moving, getting a new job, buying a new house, starting a new school
   for Lucas…ticking that off right now, I’m surprised I actually came out
   of that year alive. Whenever you reach a bend in the road, or in my
   case, six bends in the road, you’ve got to put on the brakes a little.
   But, as far as I can tell, it’s a straight shot ahead. Time to
   accelerate, right?

   With every bone of my body, I want to say yes, let’s punch it! But
   something holds me back this time. I’m ready take things out of second
   gear (I swear I’m almost done with this car/road metaphor…bear with
   me), but as I do, I’m mindful of patterns in my past. I go from zero to
   60, make some progress, but then run out of gas.
   More time with this guy More time with this guy

   So in 2016, I need to find balance. I want to balance my dreams and the
   dreams of my family. Balance my work life, home life, and hobby life.
   Balance my health and my pleasure. In order to do that, though,
   something’s gotta give. Because if I keep trucking along as I have
   been, I’m going to go all Bilbo Baggins—butter scraped over too much
   bread—and I’ll come to the end of 2016 either completely wiped or
   obsessed with a magical ring that I stole from a scrawny goblin
   underneath a moun…wait a minute, no.

   So how do I achieve balance? I divide my time and effort wisely. I
   can’t keep trying to give 100% of myself to every endeavor. Don’t get
   it twisted: that doesn’t mean I won’t be working hard. If I want to
   accomplish something, I’m going to throw my (currently considerable)
   weight behind it. For example, my annual “Oh God, I ate my body weight
   in pasta” holiday regret always turns into the cliche “Now I will make
   myself miserable on a New Year’s diet”—and I almost always pull it off.

   But what I can’t continue to do is attempt to both laser focus in on a
   goal and have multiple goals. I need to reserve energy—both creative
   and physical—in order to play with my son, write this here blog, do
   something worthwhile and enjoyable (instead of just the literal
   definition of Netflix and chill all day ery day), kick ass at work, be
   a good wife and partner, and maybe do something about managing this
   10-year-long crick in my back.

   For once, I’m not trying to conquer the world. I’m truly lucky enough
   to have checked off many of the big goals of my 30s. I can thank 2015
   for that. So in 2016, I’m going to focus on learning how to enjoy them
   and how to find happiness within myself, instead of within getting
   stuff done. This is the year of peace. This is the year of self-worth.
   This is the year I’ll find balance.

   So what’s your word of the year? Or…let’s not be coy about it…New
   Year’s resolution?

[72]Why Do We Even Have Those Seven Fishes?

   [73]December 9, 2015[74]Food[75]Christmas Eve, [76]I'm starving,
   [77]Italian Christmas[78]The Olive Gal

   The [79]Feast of the Seven Fishes. It wouldn’t be Italian Christmas Eve
   without them.

   As far back as I can remember, Christmas Eve was my absolute favorite
   night of the year. The day was spent in feverish anticipation of the
   food, songs, presents, and other shenanigans to come. And one smell
   punctuates all those shenanigans: fishy fish fish.

   When we walked up the brick stairs to my Nonna’s house, we were greeted
   by a giant plastic light-up Santa and, as we opened the front door, the
   wafting smell of seafood. Entering the kitchen, we were met by an
   already watery-eyed Nonna getting emotional whilst stirring a pot full
   of tentacles.

   Over the years our table was graced with scallops, calamari, octopus,
   haddock, cod, shrimp, salmon, and sometimes, when times were good, crab
   legs. Of course, I didn’t touch any of it for 25 years, but once I
   finally decided to eat fish, it was damn good.
   Nothing says class like mudslide shots and a middle finger. Just
   another X-mas with the Garofolis. Nothing says class like mudslide
   shots and a middle finger. Just another X-mas with the Garofolis.

   Recently, someone asked me why we have seven fishes on Christmas Eve
   and I realized that I actually had no idea. So in honor of the
   approaching holiday–one I’ll be spending with my Italian side of the
   family this year–I did a little digging.

   The Feast of the Seven Fishes is a distinctly Italian-American
   tradition, although its origins are rumored to be from Southern Italy.
   According to all-knowing [80]Wikipedia (which is a totally trusted
   source), Southern Italians, in their obsession with the Virgin Mary,
   would fast during a period they called The Vigil, which is basically
   the time spent waiting for Mary to huff and puff and blow that holy
   child out in a dirty manger.

   What does all this have to do with fish? I’m getting there. Apparently
   all that omega-3 and cholesterol helped the Virgin Mary have a smooth
   delivery.

   Okay, that’s a boldfaced lie. But here’s the likely answer. Catholics
   are the worst kinds of vegetarians. In order to fast during high holy
   days, we refrain from eating meat. But yeah, we totally go to town on
   that fish. It reminds me of this scene in My Big Fat Greek Wedding:

   IFRAME:

   ide=2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent

   So Southern Italians would maybe eat fish on Christmas Eve to honor the
   time the Virgin Mary spent destroying her vagina giving birth. Take a
   minute to let that sink in. If you’re anything like me, you are making
   all kinds of gross fish puns in your head right now.

   Anywho, us Italian-Americans…we completely bastardized the tradition.
   Because just one fish isn’t enough for us gluttons, we decided to go
   with seven. No one knows why that number, but it seems appropriately
   too large for one meal. Which is apropos, since I keep seeing this
   being shared around the Internets:

   italians_meme

   So there you have it. That’s as close to an “answer” as I could find
   doing a couple lazy Google searches. If you want more serious
   journalisming, you’ll have to pay me. A lovely seafood meal would go a
   long way…

[89]White Christmas: Chicken Soup for the Soul

   [90]November 24, 2015[91]Dance[92]best dance movie ever, [93]dance,
   [94]holiday spirit, [95]White Christmas[96]The Olive Gal

   Normally I’m all about respecting each holiday’s dance space, but this
   year my psyche is all “fuck you, Thanksgiving, you killed the Indians”
   and has moved right from Halloween into Christmas. And with that move,
   I’ll gorge myself not on turkey and stuffing, but on classic holiday
   movies full of white people dancing.

   And the best white people dancing holiday movie is, hands down, White
   Christmas.

   White[DEL: :DEL] Christmas is my chicken soup for the
   soul. Each December, my cousin Jonelle and I would curl up on our
   Nonna’s plastic-covered couch and settle in to watch our favorite
   holiday movie. Then we’d spend the next few weeks pretending we were
   the Haynes sisters. (Poor Matt had to be freckled-faced Haynes the
   dog-faced boy.)

   This movie stands the test of time because of extreme attachment
   vis-a-vie nostalgia (just like claymation Rudolph), but also because of
   its fantastic set construction (unlike claymation Rudolph). I mean, how
   many times have you walked into a train club car and been severely
   disappointed it didn’t look like this?

   white christmas club car

   The plot of White Christmas is as flimsy as a California “winter” coat
   in Massachusetts February. But the dancing. Oh, the dancing! There’s a
   minstrel number with a cast of 50,000 who are summoned to rehearse show
   material at a Vermont ski resort, even though the day before they were
   given time off to be with their families for the holidays. The show
   must go on! Families be damned! That’s the Christmas spirit.

   Still, all this escaped me as a child because I was dazzled by Vera
   Ellen.

   If you ask me, the star of this movie was not Bing Crosby. It was Vera
   Ellen. Vera Ellen should have been a bigger Hollywood name than Ginger
   Rodgers or even Fred Astaire, but her acting chops were not quite on
   par with her phenomenal dance skill. Watching her perform in this movie
   as a kid inspired me to 1. belt the shit out of my sweaters and 2. love
   dancing even more. I mean, take a look. This routine still holds up to
   today’s high standards of technique.

   IFRAME:
   [97]http://www.youtube.com/embed/yxGIHwpbKFU?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&autoh
   ide=2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent

   I will refrain from linking to all the rest of the dance numbers in
   this movie that I obsessed over as a kid (including the Martha Graham
   spoof, which again went right over my head). But you just don’t see
   dance highlighted in movies like this anymore. Yes, there are movie
   musicals, but they often feature dance doubles in weird cuts instead of
   the real thing. And yes, TV musical episodes are becoming a thing, but
   they usually feature the show’s stars with barely passable voices doing
   awkward jazz squares.

   Quick, right now, name a big Hollywood star who is known for his or her
   dancing?

   Okay, besides Channing Tatum.

   None, right? There’s none. Even those who have a background in dance
   don’t usually get a chance to showcase it. It’s upsetting and it’s
   pulled me right off topic onto a totally different tangent.

   Back to why White Christmas is the best! Did you know that Bob Fosse is
   the uncredited choreographer? Very apparent in the tilted pelvises and
   isolated shoulders of “Love, You Didn’t Do Right By Me.” (If you ask me
   who Bob Fosse is, you’re dead to me.)

   love

   Now, I know I said I love this movie, but I wouldn’t be The Olive Gal
   if I didn’t point out a completely shitty plot hole that you could
   drive a Christmas tree through. George Clooney’s aunt Rosemary spends
   the second half the movie mad at Bing Crosby because she thinks he’s
   trying to exploit his old army General. But she forgives Bing when he
   goes on TV to sing about how the General is hard up for a job. I don’t
   know about you, but I’d be way more pissed about someone singing the
   following about me on national TV than if they brought a TV crew to my
   ski resort to film their show:

   What can you do with a general
   When he stops being a general?
   Oh, what can you do with a general who retires?

   Who’s got a job for a general
   When he stops being a general?
   They all get a job but a general no one hires

   Awesome. Merry Christmas, General. Here’s so much pity from your famous
   army buds.

   Anyway, one of the best things about White Christmas is the fact that
   it doesn’t crack out on Christmas, and yet still makes you feel all
   Christmasy. Of course, that might be because this scene happens at the
   end of the movie:

   WC ending

   Okay, maybe it cracks out just a little.

   Despite the girls clearly too young for pointe shoes, this incredibly
   sappy scene, complete with audience sing-along, just puts
   everything right in the world. It’s that last sip of warm soup that
   coats your belly and leaves you satisfied but not bloated. Your
   ailments have been cured. Your Christmas will be white. And you just
   might show up to the next Christmas party dressed in that Mrs. Claus
   outfit.

   [104]One comment so far

[105]When the Going Gets Tough, the Tough Read Little House on the Prairie

   [106]November 19, 2015[107]Food[108]dieting, [109]holiday dieting fail,
   [110]Laura Ingalls Wilder, [111]Little House on the Prairie[112]The
   Olive Gal

   That Laura Ingalls Wilder. She knew a thing or two about surviving
   tough times.

   She slept in a covered wagon and ate dinner by campfire. She lived in a
   bungalow dug into the banks of a creek and swept the sod floor using
   twigs. She spent a long winter stranded on the prairie with no
   supplies, grinding wheat in a coffee mill to help feed her family.

   And then there’s me. I’m desperately avoiding running to the fridge to
   gorge myself on leftovers.

   When I find myself in times of trouble, I just can’t let it be. I think
   and overthink and think some more, and then, because it’s comfortable
   and it’s never let me down, I put food in my mouth hole and I feel
   momentarily better. That is…until I step on the scale in the morning.

   The weight came on surprisingly quick. It didn’t take much to undo
   years of clean eating and daily walks. First, I was having fun trying
   all the new restaurants in San Jose and getting to know my coworkers.
   Then I was too busy to go to the gym. Then I was exhausted from my
   [113]long commute and attempting the work/family hustle. Next thing I
   knew, the snacks were calling my name at 10pm. The number on the scale
   kept climbing. And as it did, my mood and self-confidence plummeted.

   And now I’m here, 20 lbs later, reading Little House on the Prairie.

   IMG_5893 I’m usually pretty decent at self-motivation. Not to toot my
   own horn, but I’ve overcome a few obstacles in my past, and when I did,
   I thought of myself as Laura Ingalls Wilder: strong as a stout French
   horse and full of pluck. And that’s why, when my own motivational tools
   fail me, I pick up a dog-eared copy of the classic and remind myself
   what real grit looks like. It’s a pioneer family with the balls to go
   it alone, to make up their own rules, to battle the elements and the
   lawlessness and the wild.

   So yeah, maybe they can help me with my 17-day diet.

   Those who’ve read this blog from its early days know I’ve attempted the
   [114]holiday diet before in the past and failed miserably. But with the
   help of Little House on the Prairie, I will persevere and at least try
   and make it through without tacking another 10 lbs onto my increasingly
   doughy frame.

   Potential pitfall: some of the best parts of the Little House books
   are the descriptions of delish down-home Americana meals. Pies and
   turkeys and sage stuffing and warm bread with butter. Pickled preserves
   and tasty peaches and whipped cream and…

   yeah, I just walked to the fridge.

   Goddammit! Can anyone recommend a classic, feel-good motivational
   children’s book series about a skinny bitch who thinks of food as pure
   utility and survives on raw kale and coconut oil?

[122]That One Time I Got Struck By Lightning

   [123]November 9, 2015[124]Extreme Sarcasm[125]not making this up,
   [126]struck by lightning, [127]true story[128]The Olive Gal

   This morning in San Jose, the sky was ominous and dark and the rain
   fell in sheets. As I stared out the window of our 10th floor office, I
   saw a flash of light in the sky and felt a low rumble of thunder. I was
   in a glorious happy place, contently sipping my coffee as I churned
   away at the morning’s work. Another rumble of thunder and I hear:

   “Oh my God, we’re going to die.”

   Californians. I love you guys. You are so used to undisturbed blue
   skies that the smallest hint of “weather” sends you into a melodramatic
   tailspin. Case in point, this [129]NBC Bay Area news story about
   thunder and lightning. The struggle is real.

   But while my officemates were saying their Hail Maries, I was going
   full Lieutenant Dan. I can’t help it. That’s what I do in a good
   rainstorm.

   lieutenantdan

   Which brings me to my story about being struck by lightning.

   When I was 13 years old, me and my friend Jackie Henry were hanging out
   at home doing what all bored kids do in the summertime: absolutely
   dick. Then, quick as a hummingbird’s hiccup, the weather turned. We
   went from oppressive heat to serious heat storm, the rain drenching us
   in oversized, sloppy drops. Since we were already in it, we decided to
   just run with it, hooting and hollering at the sky while terrible red
   branches of lightning reached their claws to the ground.

   “Is this all you’ve got?!” I screamed at the sky in so much irony.

   Because we were teenagers, and teenagers must immediately jump on the
   phone to brag about whatever it is they are doing, we ran inside to the
   basement after about five minutes of that nonsense, and I picked up the
   orange rotary phone. You know, the one with the exposed wire at the end
   of the chord? I grinned a toothy metal grin full of braces as I dialed
   my “boyfriend’s” number.

   I couldn’t make this shit up, guys.

   Just as the call went through, lightning lit up the sky and a zap told
   me the telephone pole had been struck. I didn’t have time to process
   that, though, because (as Jackie later recalled for me), a tiny streak
   of light danced from the receiver to my mouth and knocked me to the
   ground.

   Told yah. Struck by lightning.

   Jackie frantically stood over me shouting “Oh my God! Are you dead? Are
   you dead?” No, I was not dead. Just an idiot.

   Later that day, traumatized from my brush with death, I huddled in
   blankets and shivered as dramatically as possible for my parents to see
   when they returned home. Boy, would they be upset to learn that their
   only daughter was almost killed by lightning!

   Yeah. They laughed.

   Hard.

   Like…tears in their eyes.

   Like…doubled over.

   Like…they had to walk away.

   I was horrified. HORRIFIED! How could they laugh at such a serious
   thing?! I ALMOST DIED, GUYS!

   Looking back, I’m proud of them for not peeing their pants on the spot.
   Because if it were me, there would be no amount of hell to pay. My poor
   kid would never live it down. I’d be writing about it in this here blog
   and then bringing it up to his girlfriends the first time we met. I’d
   make a commemorative video of the moment complete with a “fuck you,
   Mom” photo taken after said lightning strike. I’d be asking him, a week
   later, “Hey, remember that time you were struck by lightning?” I’d make
   a T-shirt that said, “I was struck by lightning and all I got was this
   lousy T-shirt!”

   Okay, I’m done now. I hereby grant you all permission to tell this as a
   cautionary tale to all of your friends who think they’re badasses in
   the rain. And to your pussy California friends who really do think
   they’re going to die from a little bit of thunder when they are
   perfectly safe inside. Let me tell you something:

   You’re fine. I was struck by lightning.

[137]My Hellish Commute Is Turning Me Into She-Hulk

   [138]November 3, 2015[139]Extreme Sarcasm[140]commute, [141]road rage,
   [142]traffic[143]The Olive Gal

   I have never not commuted. Nearly every job in my adult life has taken
   me at least 30 minutes from walking out the door to plopping my
   slightly frazzled ass into an office chair. In fact, most of the time
   it’s taken me around an hour to get from the apartment/house I can
   afford to the job that barely pays me enough to afford it. So when I
   took a job in downtown San Jose, I wasn’t daunted by the idea of a
   commute.

   For the first three months of my new job, it took me nearly an hour to
   get there. Fine. Without Lucas in the car, I could spew plenty of
   swears while I caught up with family on the phone or worked on my mad
   car karaoke skills.

   Then came the start of the school year. The additional volume of school
   buses and mom vans crowding the road meant something as minor as a
   feather floating into the street could back up traffic for my entire
   route. One minute, you’re cruising along. Next minute, it’s this:

   traffic

   The infamous Silicon Valley traffic. Intellectually, I knew to expect
   it. But the recent hellish commute has tested my patience like a
   toddler throwing a mega tantrum just as you’re about to check out $150
   worth of Target swag. In the last week, it’s taken me between 1.5 and 2
   hours to get to work each morning. And that’s enough to turn even the
   most patient driver (not me) into a full-on rageaholic.

   So you can imagine the scenarios.

   When I lived in New York, my morning commute consisted mostly of
   walking. There were times when the sidewalks became crowded or when
   idiot tourists paused to look up at things (the nerve), but I could
   usually passive-aggressively huff as I sidestepped them and
   continued on my way.

   In fact, even openly aggressive expressions were not only expected in
   New York, they were considered “experiencing local flavor.” A man with
   a too-large umbrella once shoulder bumped me so hard my coffee flew out
   of my hands. On several occasions I witnessed people kicking car tires
   or pounding on hoods if the vehicles dared stop in the middle of a
   crosswalk. And God forbid if you didn’t perfect the art of the
   can’t-nobody-break-my-stride card swipe at the subway turnstile.

   So no, NYC walking commutes were no Sunday strolls, but you could
   usually get where you needed to go as fast as your legs could take you.
   And if people got in your way, you could let some of your pent up anger
   out in sanctioned, socially acceptable ways.

   In a car, on the other hand, you can’t really do much except fling
   expletive-filled epitaphs on deaf ears, pound on your horn, or hold a
   quivering middle finger up long enough for that bitch granny going 40
   mph in a 55 zone to see. And even if you do do those things, 1. you’re
   the asshole on the road, not them and 2. you’re still stuck in traffic.

   So you sit and simmer for however long your miserable commute lasts
   (1.5 to 2 hours) until you emerge so full of rage that even the
   slightest slight causes you to lose your shit. A slow Internet day, for
   example, is normally a pain in the ass but livable. A slow Internet day
   after a long commute results in this:

   fuckthiscat

   Not only have I become so full of road rage that I’ve actually done a
   cost/benefit analysis of whether I should slam into the driver’s ed
   douche canoe who cut me off the other day, but my precarious
   home/work/personal life balance has gone from teetering on manageable
   to full face plant. I actually growled at my son the other night.
   Growled.

   I’ve gone from mild mannered Jennifer Walters to full-on She-Hulk.
   Except I can’t seem to figure out how to transform back. Being
   constantly enraged will do that to you.

   I’ve tried to figure out some solutions, but no amount of audio books
   will change the fact that after two hours in the car, I want to kill
   all the things. So I’m thinking it’s back to the train life for me.
   Especially because in a couple months, my office is moving even farther
   away to the heart of the seven-lanes-grinding-to-a-halt traffic hell
   that is Santa Clara.

   Goodbye, car karaoke. Goodbye, audio books. Goodbye, She-Hulk.

   Hello, sanity!

[151]How to Be Uncool: A Lesson from Lester Bangs

   [152]October 25, 2015[153]Extreme Sarcasm[154]Almost Famous,
   [155]Lester Bangs, [156]Phillip Seymour Hoffman, [157]uncool[158]The
   Olive Gal

   Have you ever had the feeling you just don’t fit in? That’s like asking
   me, “Have you ever had a craving for meatballs and sauce?” I don’t
   understand the question. Who hasn’t felt this way at one point in their
   life?

   The unfortunate thing is, for people who consider themselves uncool
   (me), the ratio of fitting in to not fitting in is proportionately
   disparate, leaning hard in favor of the latter. Translation: uncool
   people never feel like they fit in.

   When confidence is high, this isn’t actually a problem. So what if I
   don’t fit in! I’d rather not fit in! It’s much better to be genuine and
   be myself!

   Unfortunately, another issue for uncool people is that confidence isn’t
   often high. This results in some awkward longing, some trying too hard,
   and plenty of kicking yourself HARD after you say something stupid in
   an attempt to fix the situation, which only makes it worse.
   Those are matching sweaters. And turtlenecks. And yes...broaches. Those
   are matching sweaters. And turtlenecks. And yes…broaches.

   I’ve known I’m uncool from the point cool became a thing. As a
   spindly sixth grader, I still let my mom dress me, picking entire
   outfits directly from the store mannequins because I had zero sense of
   what to do on my own. I wore braces with elastics color-coded to match
   the holiday seasons, and my granny glasses made their way halfway down
   my cheeks. My hair was frizzy and unkempt and I spent all of my free
   time either at the dance studio or holed up at home with a book. I was
   a giant target, but I was completely unaware (at first) that I was a
   target, which only made the teasing intensify.

   That year was one of the loneliest and most tortured years of my life.
   I also happened to write a 200-page novel in pencil on several
   unicorn-covered spiral notebooks. Great art, it was not. But I made
   something.

   I spent the next few years doing everything I possibly could to fit in.
   I didn’t even want to be popular, I just wanted to blend into the
   background and be left alone. I was successful. I dressed like everyone
   else. I got contacts and the braces were removed. I made a couple
   friends. I erased my entire novel, painstakingly, page by page. No, I
   didn’t just toss the notebooks. I wore down multiple erasers and then
   wrote over the whole thing with something banal, like several hundred
   rounds of M.A.S.H.

   Looking back, I think I was more miserable in the years I tried to fit
   in than during the year I realized how desperately uncool I was/am. So
   I moved on with my life, waving my freak flag freely,
   and [159]reserving my fucks to give for only the most fuckworthy of
   situations.

   In my early 20s, Lester Bangs—as played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman in
   Almost Famous—helped me embrace my uncoolness. He said that most of the
   great art in the world is made by people who are conflicted and longing
   and guilty and in pain; people who are uncool. He said:

     The only true currency in this bankrupt world is what you share
     with someone else when you’re uncool.

   And I believed him. Up until last week.

   It’s been an emotionally shitty week. Feels like I’ve been hit with the
   sledgehammer used by Lumberjack Property Brother to bust through a wall
   in order to make an open concept living space.

   Somehow, someway, I lost my confidence in being uncool. I’d been so
   caught up in Silicon Valley corporate politics that I started trying
   too hard. From a professional standpoint, I tried positioning myself as
   a certain way…and in trying too hard to “find my place,” I started
   to lose it.

   I began overthinking and asking for permission and surveying and
   questioning. I told myself it was all good because it’s important to
   strategize and think hard on these things. But that was only a portion
   of the thinking I was doing. The rest of it was hand-wringing. And I
   felt myself slipping away.

   lesterbangs Thankfully, I watched Almost Famous tonight, and as Lester
   Bangs took a long drag from his cigarette, the tightly wound chord of
   the rotary phone swinging in the background, it all snapped into
   place. It was a momentary lapse of reason. A mini existential crisis
   brought on by self-doubt. I started caring too much about what impact I
   could make, what my role should be, how other people viewed me.

   All of that is meaningless.

   At the end of the day, what I care about most is doing good work. Yes,
   of course I want people to like me—especially the people I see during
   business hours and beyond. Yes, of course I want to advance in my
   career. But ultimately, the most important thing me has always been to
   do something meaningful and to share it with others.

   So as I move into the next week, I’ll let Lester Bangs’ Almost Famous
   quote ring in my ear. I’ll go to meetings and I’ll listen and speak
   without rolling the words around 15 times in my head before they come
   out of my mouth. I’ll hold my head high as I walk the halls because
   I’ll be hunched over my keyboard the rest of the time, doing what I do
   best: writing…and being uncool.
