[3]Security Cons & Twitter - Oh the value! New to infosec?

   Hi all,
   This blog post is about Security Cons and Twitter and the new
   realisation in value I am finding.

Depending on how you use them, there is enormous value in attending
conferences and having a "vocal" twitter account.

    1. You will meet heroes.

    1. Great for self belief
    2. Gain new mentors

    1. You will meet others above, below and similar in skill level.

    1. Great for motivation, inspiration, finding new passions
    2. Make new friends

    1. You will gain new ideas and motivation.

    1. Great for keeping the daily grind going

    1. You will find belief in yourself

    1. Self belief is the most important in anything you do.
    2. You will see your life beyond that of the work cubicle and your day
       to day activities.

   The caveat:
   Learning is very lonely, people can help, guide, lead you to the water
   as they say. However you must LEARN and UNDERSTAND it yourself. To
   start learning is hard, to create habit is hard, but it must be done.
   People, conferences help with to keep pushing, to feel part of a
   community, but nothing changes that you must grind those hours (how
   many is individual) in order to build those technical skills.
   TL;DR: Go to Conferences, contribute on twitter == profit.
   My reasons are based on my personal experiences below:
   RUXCON:
   Back in 2013 I was fortunate enough to be funded by my employer to
   attend [4]Ruxcon, a security conference in Australia. I was super
   excited and it lived up to all my hopes. Not only were there technical
   talks where I could learn things, I was around people who enjoyed the
   very same thing I did, security/hacking!  This is important because at
   the time security was looked down on, due to the lack of engagement
   opportunities of bringing money in, "go do internal audit" was the
   response.
   I was lucky enough to hang out with @thecolonial, @egypt, @troyhunt and
   many others that one in infosec would typically look up too. The
   realization that these people are just like you and I, they love to
   chat, love to share knowledge is mind blowing. Mind blowing because
   there is a invaluable amount of knowledge that can come from them, just
   from a simply chat over a beer.
   In addition to knowledge sharing, people at cons inspire you, everyday
   people have very different and great ideas that it is very hard for
   inspiration not to rub off on you. You could be like me, stuck in a job
   that infosec is not a popular topic, so losing motivation can happen
   easily.
   DerbyCon:
   I was lucky enough to gain a ticket to DerbyCon (next week), I have
   already connected with people I am looking forward to meet, I have
   gained advice on introducing myself to people. I have booked to attend
   the DerbyCon family dinner. I am super excited! Enthusiasm is an all
   time high. These times are needed to help get your through the tough
   lonely nights of study.
   Twitter:
   I did not know many people in infosec within my community, reaching out
   to those on twitter and receiving near real time responses is very
   important. Twitter helps me to feel that I am part of a caring,
   breaking the limits community.
   I listen to 3 amazing podcasts, and the hosts reply on twitter! You ask
   questions, debate what they said and get a feel for how and where you
   are in relation to infosec.
   Anyone new to infosec I always tell them to listen to:
    1. [5]Defensive Security Podcast
    2. [6]Down the Security Rabbit Hole Podcast
    3. [7]Brakeing Down Security Podcast

   Some people on twitter have certs I hope to achieve one day, to
   interact with them lowers the belief that those certs are only for
   rockstars.
   A fellow OSCP:
   I moved countries, and had a lot of things happen. I had people tell me
   my learning curve is longer than most people and that their instincts
   tell them I am not and never will be technical. That is a punch in the
   guts, especially when your self beliefs are already that you have a
   learning disability.
   An OSCP joined the team, we caught up (over beers of course) and helped
   change my self beliefs. Chatting about their story, sharing mine,
   understanding that everyone starts at a different stage, which a
   different baseline was beneficial. It was not fixed overnight, however
   enough changed in me to decide once again to keep going.

[16]Quickly evading AV– simple and basic

   Hi all,

   So I have been reading “The Hacker Playbook” found [17]here and was on
   the topic of evading AV. I was also looking at my OSCP course guide as
   I am starting the labs again soon and was on AV, so I thought why not
   test it out instead of just knowing the theory!

   The Hacker Playbook goes through using powersploit and executing a
   command which can download scripts from there and run them in memory,
   one example is using a [18]keylogger and having it execute in memory.
   Pretty sweet.

   Pyinstall and all sorts of techniques were explained, most of you would
   be aware of the [19]veil-framework. So I thought I would try and inject
   a payload into an executable via msfvenom and see if AV would pick it
   up, if so I would try and see if I could evade AV.


   Testing AV evasion

   My setup is simple a Kali box and a Windows VM with Free AV installed,
   nothing enterprise size.

   So I decided to follow this tutorial from [20]Insecurety (note the 2012
   date). It is old, but with security being behind in certain areas and
   what not it was worth giving it a shot.

   The idea of injecting into a payload is explained in the post quite
   clearly as “By backdooring a legitimate executable, we can effectively
   hide our “evil” code amongst a pile of “good” code, and backdoor it in
   an undetectable manner. This means antivirus software will have a hard
   time finding our backdoor – or at least that is what we hope.”

   The key points being; hiding the malicious code amongst good code, the
   only problem is that the malicious code does not interrupt the
   execution of the program so it can easily be detected.It would be like
   trying to hide a ‘B’ in front of or behind  a line of ‘A’s. The 3 B’s
   being malicious code to launch a reverse shell for example.


     * Example: AAAAAAAAAA
     * Example of not interrupting the execution: BBBAAAAAA
     * Example 2: ‘ AAABAAAAAAABAAAAABAA’


   The example of not interrupting the execution shows the B stand out
   like a sore thumb, so an AV would simple just scan a normal executable
   and if the malicious code is all together as one, it could be flagged
   as malicious.

   Whereas in the example 2 the malicious code is broken up, making it
   harder for the AV to detect the malicious code as being a reverse
   shell.  This is a most basic example and it is how I visualize the
   process of simply injecting malicious code into a normal executable say
   putty.exe

   So following the [21]Insecurety  tutorial I created a reverse https
   meterpreter shell using putty.exe. I think copied it onto a shared
   folder to then move it onto my windows testing machine. I dropped the
   exe onto the windows machine and thought oh it worked, but after a few
   seconds it scanned the exe and found it to be malicious (my low ram may
   be the cause of the delay). I did not have to execute it, it was picked
   up before that.


   Avast picked it up a a trojan. I did a quick goole for win32 swrort and
   found from [22]Lavasoft it detects as: “Trojan. A program that appears
   to do one thing but actually does another (a.k.a. Trojan Horse).” Aka a
   backdoor.

   Example of AV warning:

   [23]Selection_001

   So I wanted to delve deeper and see if I could bypass basic AV. Since
   you need those l33t skillz. “The Hacker Playbook” in the startup phase
   has you install the veil-framework and also discusses it in the evade
   AV section. So without reading more I jumped on to install Veil and
   wanted to follow the steps in Veil for creating a payload to evade AV.

   I am a BIG fan of Python and heard much about p2exe and pyinstaller, so
   I wanted to create a Python executable that launched a meterpreter
   reverse HTTPS payload (staged version). The same payload used in the
   [24]Insecurety blog post, so I could bypass with the same reverse
   shell.

   So I followed the steps thought Veil, which is very simple.

   I created a python meterpreter reverse shell via HTTPS encrypting
   communications, and used pyherion (encrypts the data, I may do some
   more reading and post for how it works).


   You can see the options and output below:

   [25]veil_1


   So I did the same again having a new executable, nothing to do with
   putty.exe this time, but I wanted to use the same payload which my AV
   has the signature for and will detect. I dropped it on to my windows
   machine and nothing happened, *yes its on the machine*.


   I setup a msf multi handler listener to catch it. I had to choose the
   payload to be

   windows/meterpreter/reverse_https (the staged version). I believe if
   you do not set a payload it by default expects the non staged version
   of the windows meterpreter reverse https payload.
   Setting the payload:

   msf exploit(handler) > set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_https
   payload => windows/meterpreter/reverse_https
   msf exploit(handler) > exploit

   I double clicked the executable to launch it, the Free Avast popped up
   with a ‘DEEP INSPECTION’ and thought crap its picked it up, but no! It
   allowed it to execute.


   Catching the reverse shell from my python executable with my
   meterpreter shell Smile :


   [26]veil_2



   So that was a fun adventure, and it did not take too long to complete.
   Feel free to add any comments on what you have done or more in-depth
   explanation on the how and why of the evasion.

[35]Priv_checker Recon script && Free material



   Hi All,

   Been a while since posting. Gone through a lot in a YEAR, but I think
   that will be for another posting. I am more excited about some scripts
   I have been working on.

   I am planning to take the OSCP challenge in June so I thought I would
   automate some things. So far automating the checking for privilege
   checking on windows and Unix boxes and automating recon.


Python Privilege Checker

   The first I would like to present is my Python privilege checking
   script. This one I gained the idea off of a blog for an OSCP review.
   Which can be found at [36]Securitysift. Also [37]@securitysift.

   He writes it in Python as well, and as I am a great fan of Python I
   decided to write it in the same language.

   My focus is that the output is to be reviewed by me so I did not need
   to create a HTML template. As it is for when being on a box I wanted to
   use native windows/Linux command to create text files for my output.

   The most basic flow of my script is:
     * Check if Linux or Windows OS
          + If Linux: run all Linux system commands
          + If Windows: run all Windows command


   The code is on Pastebin for the month. I am figuring out an easier way
   to highlight my python code.

   I have also created a start of a batch file in case the windows box
   does not a) have python installed or b) does not allow me to run
   executables (py installer). A shell script is almost in the making in
   case I find my self on a Unix box unable to run python scripts.

   [38]http://pastebin.com/zfDihegh






Recon script

   I also gained the idea from the same blog from [39]@securitysift.

   My recon script at the moment does a simple nmap scan on all ports,
   parses the output from an XML file and runs other nmap scans based on
   the ports it finds. I wanted to use the GREP format so as to not copy
   cat [40]@securitysift but found that it is difficult to parse GREP and
   XML was much easier. So why re-invent the wheel.

   The code again can be found here:

   [41]http://pastebin.com/8pGG4fG6


   My code is in draft, aka work in progress. It does not run other
   scripts off every port nor does it run every tool for the main ports. I
   thought I would work on it more when I am in the labs  and can see what
   more I need, or even if any problems are arising.

   [42]@securitysift did the great idea of having separate python scripts
   that the main executes, so that they can be used individually if
   needed, for example dns_recon.py is a script focused on dns. Mine at
   the current time does not do that. As the focus is oscp I feel that its
   not necessary, but for real work who knows, or for team exercises
   [43]@securitysift module based scripts would be great.




Mentioning of Free material

   #Infosec is great for sharing resources and most people you would
   consider l33t are really open to questions as long as you have done
   some research or considered options. Obviously there are exceptions to
   every rule and not all people are so open, but in generally I feel it
   is a great community.

   A shout out I want to do is for [44]Cybrary.IT. You may have seen their
   funding campaign or presence on twitter ([45]@cybraryIT).  Go to their
   courses list at [46]http://www.cybrary.it/courses/ and you will see a
   gigantic list of FREE material. You will notice that have Network
   Administration and Systems administration and a BIG focus on  security,
   which I really like.

   So say for aspiring pentesters (yes I am still one) they have a great
   source of foundational material as well as post exploitation (once you
   get on a box). Many skilled pen testers / red teamers already have had
   experience in Admin experience so do not discount the other ‘not so
   infosecy courses’.


   The one course I like is the Penetration Testing course, you could
   follow this and learn a LOT of stuff. It covers basics like
   footprinting yes, but the way it is white boarded in the video really
   helps you gain the concepts. Having a quick look at additional study
   material includes other free and not free materials (as shown below).
   Their recommendations are valid, I am currently working through
   TheHackerPlaybook and its great.


   Just a little shout out to them, if you are wanting to upskill or learn
   a little more, hit Cybrary.IT up. Its free, its good quality, just be
   consistent keep at it and push through. So many materials I have that I
   jump from and too, I am finally learning to stick to one! This is a
   great path.

[72]Kali VM (NAT) + host = rookie mistake


   So readers,

   In getting back to practicing my l337 skills, I was attempting to
   invoke remote ftp file transfers via a non-interactive shell.

   Basically using the –s ftp command, which runs ftp commands in a
   script.

A non-interactive shell:

   This is basically is a shell on a remote computer (bind or reverse)
   that gives no feedback, and will not execute commands.

   It starts off like an interactive shell where you can execute commands
   remotely, then you invoke ftp, powershell and it closes the connection.


   The setup:

     Victim machine (my laptop)

   [73]image


   Attacker machine (my kali linux vm on the laptop)

   [74]image

   Normal interactive shell, you can execute commands like so

   [75]image

   Non interactive shell, invoked by the powershell command:

   [76]image

   Non interactive shell, invoked by ftp

   [77]image

   The victim (my windows laptop), breaks the remote connection, this is
   what it looks like from the victim machine. This you would not normally
   see.

   [78]image

   Due to the non–interactive shell, you are unable to execute ftp
   commands sequentially, you may want to GET a file off the host to the
   victim to do some credential dumping.

ftp –s command

   The –s command is explained here: [79]–s

   It allows you to run a text file containing FTP commands.


   So naturally you place ftp commands in a text file and run ftp
   –s:<file>. In my case ftp- s:ftp2.txt

   Like this:

   [80]image

   Which is executed from the HOST (my windows laptop), and gets a file
   from the kali VM (attacker). The script runs fine.

From Kali VM to HOST errors

   But using the remote shell and invoking the script it errors as such:

   [81]image

   I let it run for a few minutes and it would not process any further.
   Why you may ask? Well the name of the post must have given it away.

   I do not know WHY in the technical sense, but it has to do with running
   the kali vm in NAT network made, thus sharing the hosts IP address. I
   am sorry, I cannot be anymore technical than that. But as I explain
   below how I found about the issue, it must be that the ncat shell is
   from a different IP than the vm, but if that was the case invoking the
   –s command from my laptop (windows) should not be able to connect to
   it.

The work around/ fixxer upper

   Set your Virtual Machine to bridged so that it has an IP,  in the same
   network.

   VM settings> select bridged> select replicate physical network
   connection state> then click configure adapters

   [82]image

   My IP address goes from the internal VM IP address:

   [83]image

   To one in the same IP subnet as my laptop windows machine

   [84]image


   AND if we invoke the ftp –s command remotely:

   it successfully runs ftp commands from the file as shown and puts
   procdump.exe onto the victim machine (my windows laptop)

   [85]image


   note: Do change the IP address in the ftp command to the new IP address
   for you Kali VM, or like me you will be wondering why it does not work
   Smile


   Hopefully this helps some people. As last night it was giving me a run
   for my money. If anyone cares to read this far, I initially found the
   issue by remoting from a vm on laptop B to my personal laptop with the
   remote shell, I then realised the ncat connection from my kali linux
   was from the laptop B IP address and not the Kali linux VM IP address.


   Cheers,

   Haydn

[94]Some basic thoughts on the Target Data Breach


   Hi All, I happened to be given a copy of the A “Kill Chain” Analysis of
   the 2013
   Target Data Breach (majority staff report for the Chairman Rockefeller
   March 26, 2014). An article by the United States Senate. It can be
   found [95]here.

   Some basic notes:

     * Target was PCI-DSS compliant prior to the breach.
     * The initial breach was to a third-party vendor.
     * Installed malware on Target systems
     * Were able to pivot around the network
     * Were able to copy large amounts of data via FTP.

My basic thoughts on failings

   The target breach has been covered to death, from every angle. My words
   are from someone not so experienced and thinking how it could have been
   done different.

   A third party vendor was breached initially, giving the attackers the
   basic access to Target’s network:


     * There is minimal target could have done to stop attackers using
       publicly available information to create phishing attacks onto
       their vendor. I am sure nothing legal could be forced, other than
       simply asking them to have process where they remove publicly
       available information that is not required. The article explains
       Targe could have done this, but with so many vendors how would that
       be enforced, or how could it be checked that it was carried out.
       Would contracts stating that such a thing been done have been
       enough?


     * The article explains that Target could have enforced a security
       process on third parties, which I  am sure PCI-DSS compliance
       requires; by that I mean the vendor could be more secure How could
       one manage many vendors to have a base line of security? Could they
       have forced each vendor to be PCI-DSS compliant?


     * Security awareness training is recommended, saying it could have
       stopped the attack that way. My argument to this is, that phishing
       attacks are becoming so advanced these days, there is no way to
       tell if the email is ‘not’ legit. If it is a work email requiring
       some action of an employee will be in trouble, then the employee
       must prove it is not legitimate. Therefore training has a limited
       impact.


     * It is said the vendor used a free version of Malwarebytes
       antivirus. I am wondering if it would have been feasible to have a
       basic checklist for basic security, such as software licensing, or
       evidence of using a DLP or IPS for example. This could be used as
       an on boarding process for each vendor.


     * The article states that Target could have required 2 factor
       authentication. This is a great idea. Again it could be part of the
       on boarding process. I imagine this would have to be managed  by
       the vendor, as Target managing it for every vendor would be death
       by overhead. Target could simply require 2 factor authentication
       and leave it to the vendor to decide the way it is delivered. This
       would allow flexibility with vendors to choose sms to their phone,
       an rsa token or other methods.


   Installed malware on Target systems :
     * Target staff failed to act on alerts generated by software. It is
       also stated that that Target staff could have viewed this as a
       false positive, possible being overwhelmed with alerts. I read
       about this all the time, security software being misconfigured or
       not being used to its full potential, there is no point spending
       budget on something and not learning how to use it. How is one to
       confirm if their software is sending too many false positives? Is
       there a balance? A quality process of some sort should be put in
       place, follow best practice for each software. Many pieces of
       software have tuning guides.


     * The articles states Target could have paid greater attention to
       industry updates on RAM scraping malware (used in the breach). This
       is true, but there are so many updates, so many articles to read,
       how is one to keep up to date on the latest attacks. Perhaps there
       needs to be (as always is said) more sharing between companies of
       attack statistics, or a central Security Operations Centre for say
       payment card industry. That may work, everyone puts in a lump sum
       of money each year to support the SOC and the information learned
       is shared between everyone. Or perhaps the way security alerts are
       delivered via government could be improved, I can imagine industry
       being bombarded with so many alerts.

   Were able to pivot around the network
     * The article advises that target could have used white listing, a
       technique where only approved processes are allowed to run on a
       machine. In theory this is great, but if I am an attacker, I would
       assume you would be wiping any type of exe created on the file
       system, as such I would attempt to use a current process, or at the
       very least migrate into a process to look around. This can be very
       easily done with the [96]Metasploit Framework’s meterpreter shell
       command migrate which allows easy process migration (but of course
       you must be on the box in the first place). As such white listing
       does not work as well as it would sound. It is a great idea, just
       be are of its down sides. The defensive security podcast gives a
       great explanation [97]here.


     * I do not think prevention at this stage is most important, I
       believe detection to be the main focus. This is because if someone
       is on your network, there is a plethora of opportunities for them
       to privilege escalate or to pivot, just a simple default password
       missed in audits or an old firewall rule left in place could be the
       culprit. Detecting attempts or unusual behaviour would do great to
       have in place in order to detect.

   Were able to copy large amounts of data via FTP:
     * I did read once that someone claimed the attackers copied 70gigs
       via FTP. Whether that is true or not I do not know, but it is a
       high amount of data and should have been noticeable. Anyhow, the
       article says that one of the servers FTP was used to transfer the
       data to was located in Russia via plain text. It also claims this
       could have been prevented via whitelisting FTP servers. This is a
       great idea, but what about location spoofing a FTP server. I would
       have thought the attackers did that already. If whitelisting is not
       strong enough in that they can pretend to be an allowed FTP server,
       a limit to the amount of data that can be sent over time could
       work. Or a warning  sent to the security team that in x amount of
       time a high amount of data had been transferred and as such this
       was not normal behaviour and has been flagged.


   Hopefully that is a good read.

   Just some food for thought as I learn to blog about current issues and
   trends.

[106]My sexist twitter post and what I learned


   Dear readers.

   I have a confession, I ignorantly posted a sexist tweet/comment. I say
   ignorantly because I thought I was being silly or just ‘joking’, a
   simple tweet without a second thought. I went to bed thinking, oh
   someone will laugh at that comment. Boy was I wrong, and I did cop it,
   but I think they were lenient on me.

   Anyhow, my intent is irrelevant, what I have learned is how my sexist
   remark, being innocent or not is part of the whole culture of sexism,
   not just in hacking or information security as an industry, but life.

   This post is not to give an excuse, it is to show what I have learned
   from this experience, and to hope raise further awareness.

Due to the reaction my comment received I have done some research.

     * This article titled: [107]Sexism and the single hacker: Where are
       the women at Def Con?  (August 31, 2013) was a good read. Vegas is
       a place which is commonly known for booze, drugs and
       prostitutes/strippers, but as the article states it does not mean
       that is ok at a conference, or ok at all.
     * There is also this article: [108]Ending sexism in hacker culture: A
       work in progress (updated January 2nd 2013). This article covers
       the same Def Con game of Hacker Jeopardy as the above article. It
       is also updated with “Fighting sexism: an on-going process”. It is
       a good read. The following quote that I have made into a  screen
       shot is powerful.

   [109]image
     * Before my sexist comment, I had read this article without thinking
       too much into it. “[110]STOP SAYING "I HAVE A BOYFRIEND" TO DEFLECT
       UNWANTED ATTENTION” At the time I read it I was thinking yes that
       is true, women should not have to be taken for men to consider them
       ‘out of bounds’. I have been guilty of it, at a night club, being
       young and when the whole idea was to ‘get a girl’ (looking back
       now, I can see that even then it was sexist, the whole young
       culture is). When a girl is not interested, the first statement was
       ‘oh you have a boyfriend’, which in hindsight is not always the
       case. Women are allowed to not be interested due to many other
       facts than simply being taken.

   A side question to the above: In order for someone to decide if your
   push is welcomed or unwelcomed your must ‘come on’ or show your
   attracted to a women in the first place . If a woman likes the
   attention, it is not sexist, but if she does not like it, it is sexist.
   This is not to be controversial, but as this would be a typical male
   response, has anyone thought on how to handle this. I can imagine
   someone would say well it is discrimination if an attractive male hits
   on a girl and an unattractive male hits on a girl the exact same way
   and one is considered sexist while the other isn't. Is this a chick
   before the egg kind of scenario, or am I completely off track with this
   one?

   It is not an a + b = c scenario, however some food for thought perhaps.
     * A video I had watched, again prior to my sexist comment: [111]This
       is What Everyday Sexism Feels Like...to a Man


   IFRAME: [112]//www.youtube.com/embed/V4UWxlVvT1A

   This video, is very off putting to watch. Especially to someone who
   generally thinks of himself as non sexist (me) but through ignorance
   continues the culture of sexism. The video is of a man walking a baby,
   where men are treated as a sex object. It is quite an eye opener, to
   women running down the street topless and females being the dominant
   sex, purposefully opposite to the real world. Quite sad once accepting
   it as it is. A man is being hit on by a group of women, and when he is
   repulsed they call him a skank, an eye opener to that of women in the
   real world being hit on by groups of guys, and if they do not like it,
   it is the woman's fault.

   A side note to sexism in my Fiancé's experience

   Again, I did not think too much of this, perhaps I am guilty of not
   accepting or seeing deeply into others situations.

   My fiancé’ (lucky to have her now I think of it) and I opened a joint
   account, as I work full time, she was placed as the primary account
   holder. Despite this, the bank has sent a letter with my name on it,
   asking how I like the account etc. They never sent her a letter asking
   her the same thing, nor did they send a letter to the both of us.

   She tried to get a credit card to build up credit  history. Having no
   credit history she was forced to have a supported credit card (not the
   right term), one with a $600 freeze on her own money, in case she did
   not pay her account. While signing up, the banker (probably male) told
   her that I (her fiancé’) could come in and get a credit card straight
   away. Now I have no credit history either, so why that is different I
   have no idea.

   So even from a banks point of view, men are the dominant sex. She was
   very upset and angry, and I simply replied with ‘that is how the world
   is’, which neither helps or changes anything. I did say  I understood
   how she felt and she had every reason to feel that way, although it is
   not until now, that I truly understand how she felt/feels, and how
   ingrained the sexist culture towards women is.

I did not realise I was a contributor of sexism (like these articles) until
it was pointed out

   I felt completely terrible for my comment being taken as sexism, I
   would have never considered my self sexist. Yet now I realise that the
   comment was still made after I had clearly viewed awareness
   articles/videos of sexism.

   So why did it take ‘being made a fool out of on twitter’ to realise
   that sexism has very deep roots?

   Perhaps it is because whenever a sexism campaign is shown, it is at the
   very extreme (not meaning to say that it is rare) and that I was able
   to separate myself as being nowhere near what the campaigns show. This
   I would consider to be akin to road toll campaigns, where someone is
   texting or not paying attention and they are killed in some huge
   horrific car accident, I would never consider myself an idiot to do
   that, however just last night I was tired and hit a gutter driving
   home. I could have so easily been the exact reason for road toll
   campaigns, and yet I still did not think too much of it other than
   ‘oops’.

   Perhaps it is not until the ego is smashed to pieces and one can take a
   step back, and say ‘oh I have made a really big mistake’ that one
   learns the most. But it should not take your own mistake, or a big
   mistake to learn something.

   I do not have a solution to breaking the sexist culture, or to changing
   the opinion of everyday people to thinking they are not part of the
   problem, or as I mentioned above that they are not anywhere near like
   that shown in a sexist campaign. All I can say, is that I now have a
   greater understanding and awareness of sexism in hacking culture by
   having the car accident (to use the road toll analogy).

   Having a greater awareness and understanding means?

   As I always try to be more self aware and improve myself and be a
   better human being. Having a greater awareness allows me to not make
   the mistake again, to notice when small sexist things are being done
   (by small I mean not as noticeable) and to call them out. Hopefully I
   can help better things for everyone.

   I still struggle with the pulling the racist or sexist card

   Some thing's can be said with no prior thought of sexism or racism and
   people can just say you are racist or sexist in order to make your
   argument invalid. How is one to tell the difference? After my
   experience, I do not think it is worth the risk of getting it wrong, if
   someone wants to say you are racist or sexist just to cause a problem,
   that is fine, accept it, as you will never truly know.

   If they feel you are being racist or sexist that is what matters. Try
   to not be too quick to shrug off someone being upset and feeling you
   are racist or sexist as just ‘playing that card’, as I have done many
   times.


The point of the post

   The point of this post was to say I am sorry for being sexist. No
   excuses, only that I apologize and I will and can do better.

   Hopefully my post can make others aware that being ignorant does not
   stop somebody being hurt, and it does not stop a sexist culture. One
   may consider themselves separate to a sexist culture, however it could
   be said that if you are not part of the solution, you are part of the
   problem. Does that shake any bones?

   I did try to write this post from the perspective of someone who has
   constantly been attacked or abused (perhaps not the correct
   terminology), trying to understand the real issues and not belittle any
   feelings. I hope I have achieved that.


   Any feedback is welcome.

   Cheers,

   Haydn

[121]Share point installation notes

   Howdy all,
   Just a short post for those wanting a hint in the right direction for
   installing Share point 2013.
   Please note:
     * This is for a setup with a complete installation of sharepoint;
       meaning not a stand alone with a built in sql server express
     * The share point and sql server are on one server
     * It is part of a domain, so DNS, accounts are created on the domain
       controller

   Start with this video:

   IFRAME: [122]//www.youtube.com/embed/3Q9ddN0EY9M

   Why you ask?
   Because the MSDN documentation is very detailed, very exact and very
   dry reading.
   Be-careful of :
   Installing Share point stand-alone for Domain environments. It does not
   work with an active directory over a domain.
   Please install via these tutorials.
   Disclaimer:
   I am in the middle of following them and have not yet finished the
   installation. will update when it is up and running :)
   Some issues I am finding:
   Creating a web application works fine, completing a site collection
   works fine, creating a site... not so much. By not so much, I mean I am
   able to create it, just unable to access it.
   I have tried a bit of googling and found some potential reasons such
   as:
     * [123]loop back check
     * [124]Fully qualified domain name issues

   The Administration site is accessible externally. My thoughts so far is
   that through the install, windows is able to configure everything
   correctly, but sharepoint is unable to configure sites correctly,
   mainly the DNS, forward lookup etc.
   Trouble shooting so far:
   So far, there was an issue with an SSL site. What does SSL need,
   certificates, as such we went through and created a self signed
   certifcated, exported it, and added it to the share point trust zone.
   A great tutorial for that can be found [125]here
   The new issues:
     * The site works in that it asks for credentials but gives a 404 file
       not found error. So in order to troubleshoot I am trying to create
       a non ssl site to see if it is to do with SSL somehow.
     * Running slow.. very slow
     * Is crashing quite a lot, when restarting the server, when create a
       web application and a site collection

   Addressing the 404 file not found error:
   I was unable to directly fix the error in asking for credentials then
   loading a 404, i.e nothing showing up. That is, I was unable to fix the
   error for a web application that is directly created for SSL.
   A work around instead, was to create a web application without SSL, and
   then change it to have SSL. Basically creating on port 80 and then
   changing to port 443.
   As said early, the thought was the DNS server does not automatically
   configure for site collection, or the creation of sites.
   This [126]blog post, which also comes in a [127]white paper goes very
   advanced to solving sites with SSL. But do read the first part, as it
   gives great steps on creating a DNS new host A name. Which solves the
   problem of 404 file not found.
   The key take aways are:
     * Configure the DNS, to have the correct FQDN, so that being on a
       domain, allows you to connect to the site, whether it being ssl or
       standard http
     * generate a certificate for the ssl. I advise using the selfssl as
       per step 3 in the guide. Please note: you must run it as
       administrator, but doing so opens cmd at the default location. So
       you have to manually move into the selfssl directory and execute
       the command from there.
     * When importing the certificate it can be hard to find the local
       computer certificates, instead of just local user, this is why
       selfssl is really great. It does that automatically
     * Bind the website in IIS so that the website and certificate are
       bound together, i.e it knows what certificate to expect.
     * Within sharepoint, change the http to https. Alternate access
       mappings can be found under central administration, not under
       security as one would think
     * add the trust in sharepoint, add the certificate and you should be
       good to go.

   It is working
   I followed the videos, and fought with creating an ssl site within
   sharepoint. I found that following the white paper (a guide to https
   and secure sockets layer in sharepoint 2013) and changing the non ssl
   site to an ssl site worked much better. Well technically, it actually
   worked :)
   Some logging things to note
   There are many many logs consistently created. I will update this
   tomorrow with the details.
   update:
   This [128]user expains: "In my sharepoint 2010 development server
   owstimer.exe consumes  > 1.2 GB Memory". This is not exactly my problem
   but owstimer just kept crashing.

   The image:
   [129]image

   It constantly errors, so far share point is still working fine. I will
   need to trouble shoot this I think.

   Another constant error:
