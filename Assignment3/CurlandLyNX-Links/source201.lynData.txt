[41]Inspiration for the Future!

   [42][JT1.jpeg]
   My first blog here featured a picture of Baby Peter who was
   systematically abused to death by his mother and 2 lodgers, even though
   the Social Services called to his how on at least 50 times the poor 17
   moths old toddler died from as many injuries to his body where was he
   supposed to run for help?
   At that time and in spite of a Court order to the contrary my children
   were willfully withheld by their alienating mother which was going to
   prove to be over 5 years of Parental Alienation and whilst I have tried
   to rekindle my relationship with my 2 once loving sons in the past year
   today they feel like strangers to me!
   [43][Maa.jpg]
    Never the less in that time I have still sought positive and
   inspirational acts by people and have put my favorites here.
    Doreen Lawrence
   [44]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doreen_LawrenceFollowing the murder of
   their son in 1993, Doreen and Neville Lawrence believed that the
   Metropolitan Police investigation was not being conducted in a
   professional manner, citing incompetence and racism as prime flaws.[3]
   In 1999, after
   [45][JT2.jpg]
   years of campaigning, and with the support of many in the community,
   the media[4] and politics, a wide-ranging judicial inquiry was
   established by Jack Straw, the Home Secretary. Chaired by Sir William
   MacPherson, the inquiry was to investigate the circumstances of
   Stephen's death. The public inquiry was the subject of intense media
   interest which became international when it concluded that the
   Metropolitan Police was "institutionally racist"[5] and that this was
   one of the primary causes of their failure to solve the case.

[59]RIP Baby 'P'..one day maybe?

   [60][article-2136422-0D47632400000578-953_468x286.jpg]
   Damages claim: Miss Shoesmith is battling for compensation of £1million
   after being sacked over the case of Baby P (above) who died from abuse
   in 2007 My first ever blog on here featured the trgic story of 17 month
   old Baby Peter Connelly it seems nothing was learned when the council
   moved on in 2007!

   More scandal: Haringey council's former head of children's services
   Sharon Shoesmith (above), who was sacked over the Baby P case, presided
   over another child abuse crisis involving the neglect of ten youngsters
   Sharon Shoesmith should have been prosecuted in my view, not
   compensated. If I drove a 40 ton truck on the M1 motorway and was
   distracted from my duties by adjusting the radio or spilling my coffee
   then ploughed into a car killing a 17 month old child, the press and
   public would be baying for blood and I would have expected a jail
   sentence even though it had never been my wish nor intent for this to
   happen. In the same way the juggernault Ms. Shouemith was in charge of
   and on a salary 10 times what I earned as a truck driver meant she was
   neglegent in allowing 2 of her officers to attend Peters home 60+ times
   unchecked, (this is also the number of injuries this poor little chap
   had on his body when found dead)anyone with even modest parental
   instincts would have guessed something was wrong within one or two
   visits!

[73]In my life : Parental Alienation!

   I recently saw this Lennon penned and vocalised Beatles song performed
   by Bet Midler in the film 'For the Boys!' and whilst the lyrics did
   seem to fit the bill I believe the slower more edgy version by Ozzy
   Osbourne will have some resonance with those of us who have endured the
   heartache of parental alienation!
   [74][PAS%2Bmind.png]
   In spite of 'winning' the battle in Family Court and offering a second
   family home close by "in the best interest of my children" a process
   that went on to bankrupt me, my children have been withheld by the
   mother for 4 years 5 months! now I face the pain and anguish along with
   the prospect of regret my children may feel should we ever try to
   rekindle our relationship in the future.

   IFRAME:
   [75]https://www.youtube.com/embed/kRgGkSPzGek?feature=player_embedded

   Today I face my second family home being reprocessed any time soon by
   those state backed bandits the CSA, whilst my children languish in a
   home ,just 100 yards away which is mortgage free and purchased with the
   asset of the original family home.
   I would like to dedicate the final moments of the above video to all at
   the CSA including the Minister who is content to preside over this
   corrupt department. I also wonder if Lord Justice Leveson would
   consider putting as much effort into a true review of Family Justice
   once he as finished being so concerned for phone hacking?
   I wonder if there is any significance in publishing this item on the
   unusual date of 29th February?

[86]Family Justice Review : My Version!

   IFRAME: [87]http://www.youtube.com/embed/udpzigT8IfU

                       Dedicated to Eddie and Matthew.

   This Autumn The Ministry of Justice in London will publish its findings
   of the Family Justice Review to which I participated as part of the
   Partners Group who has contributed to this enquiry for the past 18
   months. I have already detected a number of shortfalls, therefore I
   have set out my Version of how it should read from my first hand
   experience at entering Family Court in March 2004. My contact with
   Family Court Judges, Solicitors, Barristers, CAFCASS, Social Services
   and Police ultimately to the CSA and above all the impact this has on
   my Children for when this should have been ‘in their best interest’.
   Instead what I witnessed between March and October 2004 ranged from
   inconsistency to outright corruption. Therefore I embarked on what has
   become almost 8 years of research worldwide within input right across
   the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Singapore, Greece
   and a number of European Countries. I have converted my findings into a
   frank and honest Blog and I regard this Blog as the defining
   culmination by this reluctant campaign.
   I hope that any shortfall in the Ministry of Justice version on the
   Family Justice Review can be made up from my contribution here and both
   could lead to this God awful law being reformed!
   C.S.A./CAFCASS: For me The Coalition Government could make immediate
   savings by disbanding both of these ineffectual organisations, neither
   have a place in Family Justice as I will show in the following
   paragraphs:-
   SOCIAL SERVICES: I believe Social Services has no place in Family Court
   (they are ill-equipped) and rather like CAFCASS will offer the Family
   Judge a snapshot and spurious testimony to which a Judge feels duty
   bound to apply, making CAFCASS and Social Services his scapegoat for
   the future, to offer irreversible orders to whom nobody beyond that
   Judge can scrutinise.
   Social Services should only be called upon in the case where there is a
   ‘History’ of Violence or Abuse prior to a couple coming to Court NOT as
   a weapon of false allegations once they have arrived at Court. Social
   Services should be left to concentrate on Child Welfare so Horror
   Stories, such as Baby P, Victoria Climbie and Khyra Ishaq are reduced.
   FAMILY COURT JUDGE: Of the 6 or so Judges I came before most were
   reasoned balanced people who even if I regard their view as against me
   I saw the reasoning behind it. I did however come before one
   patronising and biased Judge who seemed to perpetuate premise of Single
   Parenting and by strange coincidence at this time I read an article
   that said Ambitious Judges who go against the Father have greater
   chance of promotion and so was the case here. This D.J. reserved my
   case for her sole consideration but was made up to H.H.J. during the
   process so failed to appear at the final hearing, instead a fellow D.J.
   whom I regarded as her ‘Lacky’ sat in and just went along with the
   biased Judges’ rhetoric.
   Closed Court precludes any balance analysis of proceedings and when
   Jack Straw as our one time Justice Minister attempted to ‘Open’ the
   Court, he was met by derision by the very Judges who should have been
   called to account. Camilla Cavendish, who won an award for her Family
   Law column in The Times, was one of the first Journalists to be invited
   into Family Court in Ipswich and it was clear to me that at that time
   the same safeguards put in place for sensitive criminal cases could
   apply to Civil Laws, i.e. Child A, Family XYZ or even a serial number
   Journalists could refer to a case when given out to news of Parliament.
   Judges either willingly or otherwise collude with Barristers and
   Solicitors in perpetuating this corruption where financial gain can be
   achieved by their Court, rarely do they benefit either party, least of
   all the children involved and due to the closed nature of these Courts
   there is no accountability (if you appeal is it likely one Judge will
   contradict another).
   Money is the fuel to injustice and closed courts hide this fact from
   public scrutiny!
   BARRISTERS AND SOLICITORS: The moment a couple steps into the Family
   Solicitors office they are perpetual conflict and whilst some
   Solicitors claim to offer Arbitration services (mine and my ex-partners
   did not), this goes against the grain of what they want to do, which
   insures they plunder the Legal Aid system for Mum whilst rendering Dad
   bankrupt with no regard to the Child’s welfare as they are supposed to
   subscribe to in Court. The Barristers take a similar line, I spent an
   entire duration debating the safety of allowing my Children to ride on
   their Go-Karts near the Road and the last 2 minutes for me to be told
   to leave the Family Home! All Smoke and Mirrors I’m afraid which
   because claimants should they want to perpetuate false allegations,
   which on one occasion for me was that I was an alcoholic (in fact I
   drink less alcohol in a year than some do in one weekend) spurious as
   in fact at the time I was employed to drive 40 tonne trucks for
   Salisbury’s, Tesco and M & S, I doubt if these would have allowed such
   a person to take charge of a £100,000 vehicle and Loads of a similar
   value.
   The Law Society, or whatever they call themselves these days, cannot
   make a complaint against a firm of Solicitors for fear of being sued,
   they do not have the teeth to regulate as they should!
   GRANDPARENTS: At the beginning of June this year I read a copy of The
   Mature Times and was dismayed to learn that the Family Justice Review
   did not see the merit in giving Grandparents rights of contact with
   their Grandchildren. I am of the view that when Parents maybe in
   dispute and possibly separating, who better to offer stability and
   continuity to children than Grandparents or other Family Members where
   appropriate.( Thanks Sir Bob).
   Surely this would be better then Social services making their trademark
   snap-shot appraisals that all too often can result in children ending
   up in irreversible care. The very people who Social Services and family
   court should be serving , the children end up living a life full on the
   regrets instilled by this very system. I have an example of a case
   where a parents dogs often barked, it turned out they had kennels so
   the RSPCA were called but no problems were found none the less the
   Social Services got wind inspected the home and an 8 year old girl was
   put into irreversible care even when it was later proved there was no
   problems here either!

   IFRAME: [88]http://www.youtube.com/embed/4WPaE8s2Occ

   Police: The police have no role to play in family (civil) law as they
   can only deal with criminal law but it does illustrate the starkest
   discrimination the law has to offer.
   In my case the initial court order allowed contact with my children to
   take place via the schools so as to avoid conflict with the mother we
   would each collect and return them to school at our contact times and
   this worked fine for over one year.Sadly , and with the help of the
   biased judge contact was changed so it had to take place outside the
   former family home. So as per the revised court order I would show up
   at the prescribed time and place ready to take my sons on for the
   evening or weekend etc, but then the mother would start withholding the
   youngest which caused more problems when it later turned out she was
   bribing him to stay whilst my eldest was almost penalised for coming
   with me. When I objected to my son being with held, ( he was always
   pleased to see me after school) the police would be called and in spite
   of me waving my court order almost Chamberlain style they were unable
   to enforce it on the mother but were happy to arrest me for breaching
   the peace if I did not leave confusing the old boy so by 2007 he to was
   with held and to this date I have not had any of the Court appointed
   contact and all the police will say is take the mater back to court,
   what is the point? Mothers are regarded as ‘civil’ whilst Fathers are
   seen as criminal!
   Childhood is such a short span of time we should protect it at all
   costs!
   Children: Children in all walks of life have been given rights in order
   to protect them and this is right and proper.Except, I believe, between
   the ages of 11 and 16 where I feel Parental responsibility should not
   be overruled by a child’s right when all to often they are too young to
   reason the ramifications. It cannot be right that a child can sue a
   parent for a relatively minor dispute or indeed be allowed to make
   false allegations just ask the teacher too!
   However in the sacred secret world of Family Court who’s continued
   rhetoric is ” in the children’s best interest!” seldom allow the
   children to be heard and all the judge has to work with is a contrived
   interpretation from a court reporter (SS or CAFCASS) where mother has
   been the dominating force so the children end up acting on her will not
   what they truly want which in most cases is to see as much of both
   parents as possible in spite of separation!
   I will go into this more in the paragraph headed The Process further
   on. I do however believe that children who reach secondary school age
   should be given the right to alter a court order as their live will
   become more flexible in their teens and they may just wish o pop in and
   see either parent at odd times and should not be constrained by an
   order designed to show them routine and stability in their younger
   years. Also there may be times a child wants to play football and have
   dad there during mum’s contact and mum may want to take them to the
   cinema during dads contact this should be agreed amicably and not by
   seeking to score points off each other or try to show one parent in a
   better light then the other. Mothers should no longer be seen as the
   resident parent and father as the absent one, they should be equal in
   their parental responsibilities.
   PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY: The most important role a person can have in
   life is that of a Parent. We all come to it with trepidation and rely
   on our Parents’ experience to handle the initial ‘shock’, but by the
   time a second child comes along skills are gained and we feel more
   relaxed, but nonetheless most parents will still have their childrens’
   best interests at heart.
   One of my children had a soft nature so would cry or object to the
   slightest thing when young. My other Son was more robust and would walk
   in with blood dripping from his knee from a football injury but would
   say nothing. As a caring Dad I would apply the same level of care to
   both children just in case.
   I would link PR to equal Parenting, both Parents would appear on the
   Birth Certificate should be subjected in law to being responsible for
   their Child’s Welfare to the age of 18 or leaving home/full time
   education. Not only in the case of nurturing, education, feeding and
   home security but as a child gets older and is capable of breaking the
   law whilst their age all to often enables them to be immune from the
   law and at such times I believe the Parents (BOTH) should be liable for
   Fines, Reparation even imprisonment in the case of a Child committing a
   serious offence such as Rape or Murder.
   This I believe would focus the minds of Parents from the start (and
   maybe would be under age Parents) that it is down to them to make the
   best effort to do the right thing for their children and not to enter
   into such an undertaking without considering such facts that could lead
   to legal ramifications.
   I would give credit to much of my opinions on child welfare to Shaun
   Bailey. He is a wise head on young shoulders and certainly inspires me,
   I just wish others would listen to this quietly spoken champion of the
   young!
   Education:
   As a Sub-Heading to this paragraph I would seek to align School with a
   remit of PR. We entrust Teachers with the care and welfare of our
   Children for a larger part of their childhood than we see them
   ourselves so in respect to the Teachers and our responsibility as
   Parents we should share the task of instilling morals, respect and
   responsibility onto young minds. Children should be controlled and
   disciplined when needed by Parents and equally by Teachers. I would
   also suggest this points to the Education fraternity.
   1.Children to be monitored throughout their Primary years including
   Pre-School and a Report drawn up in the Final Year of Primary School
   that outlines an individuals’ potential, so that any shortfalls are
   clearly identified before they move onto Secondary Education and
   endeavours are made to eradicate such shortfalls before the end of Year
   6.
   2.Year 6 should be seen as a preparatory year in readiness for what the
   Child will have to face at Secondary School and to be aware of Peer
   pressure, Media pressure, the importance of what they can attain from
   an appropriate Education, Legal Studies, so rights and ramifications
   can be investigated then finally Sex Education, as by age 11 children
   would have some understanding today.
   3.A true appraisal of an individuals’ ability assessed, so those who
   excel in academia can follow that route. Those who do not, should be
   encouraged in aspects they do excel at, such as, Sports, Arts, Music
   etc and so long as they are supported in the basics of Reading and
   Writing, should from Year 7 be directed toward vocational training so
   they can learn Skills and Trades more appropriate to their ability.
   4.National Service seems to carry some form of stigma who went through
   it in the Post War Years. I would however, advocate those children who
   seek to leave School without Qualification at the earliest leaving
   date, should be made aware they will only be eligible for Benefit which
   will only be paid by attending some form of apprenticeship or Further
   Education culminating in the completion within a minimum 3 Year Course,
   that they will then leave with a recognised Qualification or Vocational
   Skill, otherwise the previous 3 year benefit payment will be refundable
   to the Educational Authority.
   It is important that we start now as this proposal will take at least a
   generation to come through in real terms and a better attitude will
   emerge by those given this opportunity as our Citizens of the future.
   The last question asked on the M.O.J enquiry was ” What question should
   we have asked?” I offered the suggestion that the number of suicides
   attributed to failing Family Courts and CSA worldwide should be
   considered!

   No good wearing a purple scarf Dave if you don't really mean it!
   Would you prefer this;
   [89]http://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/publications/policy/moj/family-
   justice-review-final-report.pdf
   Or this? Davey's Law!

   THE PROCESS: FAMILY JUSTICE REFORMED: Separating Parents should BOTH be
   eligible for £500 in Legal Aid so as to arrive at a conciliatory
   process for the ultimate benefit and security of the children and
   should submit their claims simultaneously to an Arbitration Service
   such as ACAS for a jointly agreed order referring to:-
   Shared Care
   Parental Responsibility
   Contact (Reviewable when a Child reaches Age11)
   Residency
   Financial Settlement and Maintenance
   This Contract should be binding and presented to a Senior Judge who
   will also confirm this is Legal and Binding and up to both parties to
   ensure it works otherwise it is enforceable on each Parent.
   Solicitors and Barristers would not be required at this stage as there
   would be no disputes and therefore would not need to be perpetuated.
   Social Services and CAFCASS need not apply, unless there is a history
   of Violence, Abuse or threat to the Childrens’ Welfare by EITHER
   Parent. If the Judge has any concerns he should have access to the
   Familys’ Medical history and thereafter order an investigation so as to
   prevent false allegations arising at point of separation.
   Once it is made clear that this order is binding and enforceable on
   BOTH Parents, should they wish to return matters to Court it will have
   to be at the individuals’ own expense as no future Legal Aid will be
   available and this should focus minds by all concerned to get it right
   first time.
   I have sought to remove the financial incentives and conflict from the
   Family Court so there would be very rare need for Solicitors,
   Barristers and social services there!
   Grandparents should also have rights of access after separation, but
   where possible to have access to coincide with the Parents Contact, but
   above all to be there to show support, stability and continuity to very
   young children.
   Childrens’ Schooling should not be disrupted and both Parents should
   stay in close contact with the School as often as possible.
   Parents should also keep the Children with the same Family GP and
   notify each other of any concerns that may occur during their
   respective contact times.
