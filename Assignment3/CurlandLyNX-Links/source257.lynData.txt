About WeAreTechnology

   Welcome to our section dedicated to women working in Technology.  This
   section contains IT related news, inspirational stories, job
   opportunities, IT related events and most importantly visibility of
   organisations who are actively seeking technologists to give back and
   help future generations.

   We are acutely aware that there is still a shortage of women in IT and
   that young girls in schools are not choosing Technology as a career.
   We are also aware that there are not enough female technologists
   operating a senior or board level, we would like that to change.   Our
   contribution to that change is by helping to raise the visibility of
   the individuals, organisations and charities who dedicate themselves to
   the progression of women in IT everyday. We hope you enjoy this new
   feature section and if we have missed anything or if there is anything
   you would like to see, please let us know – contact
   [137][email protected].
