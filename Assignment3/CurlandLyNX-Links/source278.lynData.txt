[12]Why I’m #ReadyForHillary

   [13]February 17, 2016[14]Politics[15]barack obama, [16]Bernie Sanders,
   [17]Election 2016, [18]Hillary Clinton, [19]ReadyForHillary[20]Zeke
   Weeks

   This isn’t going to be a full-throated piece about how one politician
   will be the solution to all of America’s problems. It won’t convince
   you that any candidate is best on the issues, and it certainly won’t
   get you excited about another election year. But I’m to the point where
   I’ve weighed my thoughts on this and want to share them, because it’s a
   little different from the perspectives I’ve been hearing.

   Here’s the short version: I really want Hillary Clinton to be the next
   President. Not because of her stances on the issues. Not because of how
   her campaign is going. It’s because Hillary Clinton is fucking
   presidential. I think she will be the best president in decades in
   terms of accomplishments that move the country forward.

“Hold up, Zeke. Didn’t you vocally oppose Hillary Clinton in 2008?”

   Yep, and this was part of my path towards wanting her to win in 2016. I
   got excited about Barack Obama in 2006, before he formed the
   exploratory committee for his campaign. In short, he seemed like the
   most promising candidate for the presidency since John F. Kennedy. His
   campaign centered around a politics of common ground and bringing a
   fresh start to Washington. You don’t need to look farther than this
   blog to find [21]plenty of fierce criticism of then-Senator Clinton’s
   campaign. I felt like Senator Clinton represented the status quo, and
   that she ran a campaign with all the usual ugly tactics while Senator
   Obama offered an inspiring campaign and a preferable platform.

“So what happened?”

   Barack Obama won. The Republican party started its mission to obstruct
   President Obama above all else. But along with the presidency,
   Democrats held both houses of Congress for Obama’s first term. They
   made some major achievements they campaigned on; most significantly,
   the biggest improvement to healthcare in 50 years (albeit on the model
   that Hillary Clinton advocated in the 2008 primary – Obama originally
   preferred single-payer healthcare). But ultimately, Barack Obama’s
   campaign for hope fell far short of what many hoped for. I could write
   a whole piece about this, but for now I’ll just link to
   [22]PolitiFact’s “Obameter” which tracks his campaign promises.

   Throughout his presidency, I’ve had mixed feelings about Barack Obama’s
   legacy. In the last seven-plus years, America has in some ways become a
   better example of the ideals it strives to stand for, and in others,
   we’ve gotten worse. President Obama’s administration owns partial
   credit or blame for this, as does an obstructionist Republican Congress
   built on overtly racist gerrymandering and voter suppression tactics.

   Since 2008, I’ve thought a lot about what makes an effective president.
   Only the hardest problems make it all the way to the president’s desk,
   and usually none of the options will match perfectly with the
   president’s ideals. I’ve studied each president since the Johnson
   administration with an eye for both their expressed ideals and their
   actual effectiveness during the presidency. We’ve had strong idealists
   from both parties, as well as plenty of pragmatic administrators.
   Ultimately I don’t think idealism or pragmatism determines a
   president’s effectiveness, but it has led me to believe that what’s
   said during a presidential campaign is an utterly poor predictor of how
   good a president will be. In shorter terms: I loved Barack Obama the
   campaigner, but it wasn’t enough to deliver on much of his vision.

“Enough about President Obama. Why Hillary Clinton?”

   Secretary of State Hillary Clinton turned me around. My bitterness
   about her primary rivalry with my preferred candidate was turned into a
   high opinion of how she represented the United States and addressed
   complex policy issues during a time of significant international
   upheaval.

   As I studied other aspects of American history, especially Bill
   Clinton’s political history (which I did from a fairly neutral academic
   perspective), I learned more about Hillary Rodham, and her long history
   of work to improve conditions for all kinds of American families. She
   has always been a policy wonk and has a keen interest in finding a path
   to progress, especially through political obstacles. And since 1991,
   she’s been doing this on the national stage. In terms of knowing how to
   get things done in Washington, I can’t think of any person better than
   Hillary Clinton.

“Laaaaame, don’t you #FeelTheBern?”

   I’m so glad Bernie Sanders is in this campaign. And he’s got a great
   platform. I just think Hillary Clinton will accomplish more for his
   cause than Bernie Sanders could if he won the presidency. I will vote
   for Sanders if he wins the nomination, and would love to look back at
   this post in eight years in embarrassment if it means his platform
   became reality. I just am more fired up about what Hillary Clinton has
   been accomplishing in positions of leadership for her whole life.

“You’ve got to be kidding. What about Clinton’s record on ______?”

   I’ve disagreed with Hillary Clinton about plenty of things, big and
   small. But I agreed with campaign-Obama on almost everything, and now I
   find myself looking for qualities beyond just politicians’ positions on
   the issues or how well they’ve avoided controversy in the past. If
   Clinton wins, I’ll continue to participate in activism that challenges
   her on many fronts. Ultimately, I am more interested in effective
   governance than I am in politicians who I like most on paper.

In conclusion

   This has been a frustrating election so far. I find myself
   disillusioned with the disconnect between what seems to matter in a
   campaign, and what actually brings progress in Washington. It means
   that I’ve been trying to tune most campaign coverage out. But since I
   started watching Hillary Clinton’s tenure as Secretary of State, and
   learning more about her history, I’ve been silently wondering just how
   much she could get done from the Oval Office. I’m excited by the
   prospect and really would love to see her there in 2017.

[24]Video: Colorado.gov Adopts Drupal, Learns Some Things

   [25]July 29, 2015[26]Technophilia[27]Colorado, [28]drupal,
   [29]government[30]Zeke Weeks

   I recently did a joint presentation at DrupalCamp Colorado with
   Jeremiah Wathen, my project management counterpart at Colorado
   Interactive. We talked about Pacific, Colorado.gov’s Drupal-based
   hosting platform for hundreds of state and local entities, and what
   Colorado.gov has learned with each increasingly ambitious project
   since the initial decision to adopt Drupal.

[32]Video: Parachuting into Drupal Crazy

   This week I spoke at the [44]DBUG Drupal meetup in Denver about an
   unglamorous but very important thing that comes up for any
   technologist: turning around applications that have, for one reason or
   another, left their users unhappy.

   I also had no idea that DBUG meets in a TV studio and is broadcast live
   on public access TV and the web. Thankfully, my doctor has me on some
   really good blood pressure meds.

   My talk covers some of the strategic, technical, and personal things
   that people can do to fall back in love with their Drupal applications
   again. (The non-technical aspects are really applicable to any
   software.)

   (I start my talk at the 19 minute mark.)

   I want to thank DBUG for inviting me, and [46]Aten Design Group and
   [47]Denver Open Media for their sponsorship and work to make this event
   happen.

[49]Keep life priorities in balance: Check.

   In my personal life, I’ve always been one to prefer spontaneity over
   structure; relaxation over regulation. For a long time, I’ve clung to
   that at home as a way to compensate for all the organization that’s
   crucial in my work. But this summer, I’ve been trying something more
   deliberate to keep a balanced daily life. Every day after work, I make
   sure to do a few things: [62]Continue reading →

[63]My Resolution for 2013 That Worked: Carrying a Real Camera Everywhere

   [64]January 1, 2014[65]Daily Life, [66]Photos[67]new years,
   [68]photography, [69]resolutions[70]Zeke Weeks

   2013 was the first year I made a New Year’s resolution: to carry a real
   camera around everywhere. It went great!

   Photography has been a strictly casual hobby throughout my life. It’s
   always been something that lets me capture enjoyable things that happen
   in my life, but never something that itself became a focus of my life.
   So why make a New Year’s Resolution for it? Aren’t those things usually
   done with the intent of bettering our lives?

   The answer lies in how most of us have changed our photography
   habits: anyone with a smartphone is carrying a camera with them
   everywhere. Before smartphones, I was carrying along more traditional
   cameras to events where I thought I’d want them: vacations, concerts,
   and the like. But smartphones were the ultimate popularization of the
   old photographer’s adage: “The best camera is the one you have with
   you.”

   Now, blame my twentysomething lifestyle, but many of the best moments
   in my life happen in the shadows – exactly where tiny cell phone
   sensors struggle to perform. Concerts, restaurants, twilight walks, and
   the like. I started finding myself out with something great going on,
   taking out my camera, and getting results that made me feel like I
   wasted my time even bothering to take a picture. That was it, really –
   I guessed that I’d capture more good moments if I carried a “real
   camera” to it all. [71]Continue reading →
