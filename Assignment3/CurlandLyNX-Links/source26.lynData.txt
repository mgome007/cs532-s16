Hawk Weisman

   I’m a student studying Applied Computing with a focus in Software
   Engineering at Allegheny College in Meadville, Pennsylvania. I’m
   primarily interested in the design and implementation of programming
   languages, systems programming and operating systems, and improving
   tools for programmers and software developers, although I’m always
   interested to learn more about just about any area of computer science.

   My favourite programming languages are Scala, Rust, and Lisp, and I
   also have a lot of experience programming in Java and Python. I love
   learning new programming languages — I’m currently learning more about
   Haskell and C.

   My friend [8]Max Clive and I founded [9]MeteorCode Labs to develop and
   publish indie games. We’ve currently released an open-source game
   engine, [10]Pathway, and we’re working on some more fun stuff.

   I’m currently looking for summer internships and part-time programming
   jobs, so if you’re interested to hire someone with my skills, please
   don’t hesitate to [11]let me know.

Open-Source Projects

     * [12]Alexandria: An open-source library card catalogue application.
       (Scala)
     * [13]Pathway: An open-source event-based game engine for the JVM.
       (Scala, Java)
     * [14]seax: A virtual machine-based runtime environment for
       functional programming languages. (Rust)
     * [15]DeeBee: A tiny relational database supporting a subset of SQL.
       For educational purposes only. (Scala)
     * [16]Decaf: An alleged compiler for a so-called programming
       language. (Scala)
     * [17]USL: The Useless Stack Language. A simple toy language with
       some interestingly weird semantics (think Lisp meets PostScript).
       (Scala)
     * [18]remote-collab: A SublimeText 3 plugin for remote pair
       programming. (Python 3)

Other Neat Stuff

     * [19]Boids implementation in Haskell
     * [20]L-Systems implementation in Scala and Processing
     * A [21]Python script for calculating recipes for the bread from Chad
       Robertson’s Tartine Bread
     * [22]Jekyll layouts for Big presentations
     * My [23]dotfiles
