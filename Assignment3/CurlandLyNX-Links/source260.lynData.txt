Welcome to George's Junk

   Welcome to a redesigned George's Junk website. Here you can find
   anything I deem interesting :)

   Currently on this site you can find my blog, a few bits and bobs on the
   web design I do - primarily with the Joomla! CMS system. Finally you
   can see about some of the physics I find interesting as I make my way
   through the last part of my placement year and my final year studying
   physics at Bristol Univeristy.
