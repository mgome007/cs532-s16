About

   Hi. I'm Kenneth Love.

   I'm a web developer and designer living near Portland, OR with my wife
   and our two sons. I've been a freelancer/consultant for years, mostly
   doing Python & Django development with a smattering of HTML, CSS, and
   Javascript work in there, too.

   I'm also a teacher at heart, helping people out on IRC and through my
   video series, [5]Getting Started With Django and by giving talks &
   tutorials at DjangoCon & PyCon.

   When I'm not on a computer, I like to enjoy the PNW's food and scenery
   with my family, take photos, and play board games.

   Getting in touch with me is pretty easy. You can email me at
   [6]kenneth@gigantuan.net or hit me up [7]on Twitter.

Desires

   This is a strange section for a consultant/resume site, huh? Well, I
   figure it's best if I tell you what I'm looking for in addition to what
   I can do (that's in [8]the next section, if you need to jump ahead).

   I've spent years of my life writing code for other people, building
   CMSes, stores, and other things that make the Internet work. It's good
   work but it can get a bit tedious and mentally exhausting after awhile.

   Lately, I've been getting back into web design. I've also been picking
   up more serious Javascript (Node.js, Backbone, and the like) and I'd
   love a chance to do this more seriously again. But:

What I really like is teaching

   Since teaching is something that I'm rather passionate about, I'd love
   work in the education sphere. I don't necessarily mean working with
   schools (although that's great) as I consider corporate training,
   reference book writing, and lecturing to all be "education" as well.

   If you're involved in bringing people into the technology industry in
   any way, [9]we should talk.

Work

   I've been in this game for a long time. Some of the places I've worked
   with/for over the years:

     * [11]Tindie
     * [12]Apartments 24-7
     * [13]Brick

   I've also released a few somewhat popular Django packages with a good
   friend of mine:
     * [15]django-braces
     * [16]djrill

   I created and am still working on [17]a video series for teaching
   people Django and I co-hosted a couple of popular podcasts:
     * [18]The Forrst Podcast
     * [19]The Django Round-Up

   And, lastly, I should probably list out my skills (in no particular
   order) so you know if I'm a good fit for your needs or not:

     * Django
     * HTML
     * Javascript
