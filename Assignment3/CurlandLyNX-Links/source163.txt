	<h1>St. Andrew's Successfully Hosts Area F Convention with Advanced Certamen Winning Austin-Area Championship</h1>
	<div class="story">
	On Friday, February 20 and Saturday, February 21 the St. Andrew’s Upper School Latin Club hosted and competed in the Area F Latin Convention. The Middle School certamen team comprised of Tristram Coffin, Jack Cowan, Henry Erlinger, Gina Perkins, and Will Snider won second place by one question in an incredibly close final round.  The Intermediate certamen team comprised of Layne Alam, Jack Guttell, and Gavin Massengale also won second place. The Advanced team comprised of Bryce Deskins, Rachel Nezzer, Katherine Salinas, Walton Schmidt, and Jonathan Zornio, plus alternates Max Bartee and William McKinnerney, played an amazing final round, won first place and will combine with the LASA team to represent the Austin area at the state tournament.<br />
As a school, St. Andrew's Upper School took second in the overall Academic sweepstakes and third place in Olympika sweepstakes, calculated by assigning points for first, second, and third place finishes.  One student was recognized for having the highest score at any level on his tests.  Bryce Deskins was recognized for having the high score on the Roman History test.  Bryce was awarded a scholarship for $519 ($1 for every convention attendee) in recognition of his high score achievement on the Decathlon test out of all the seniors at the convention.  Additionally, Katherine Salinas got the highest score on the Pentathlon of all students in level III, a great accomplishment as every student at the convention takes that contest.  Katherine also did a fabulous job of serving as Area F Chairperson and hosting the convention.  She has worked for a year to make sure that the convention ran smoothly and that everyone had a good experience.<br />

We so appreciate the many, many faculty, parents, students and alumni who helped us to host the event.  We are so grateful for all the help with testing, supervision, judging, and more.

Congratulations to all the winners and bonam fortunam omnibus at State.  The State Convention will be held on March 26-29 at Amarillo High School.<br />

	<h1>Certamen Teams Have Good Showing at Annual Cru Classic</h1>
	<div class="story">
	This past weekend, teams from all over Austin competed in the annual Crusader Classic Certamen tournament. Every year St. Andrew's and St. Michael's switch off on hosting the tournament, bringing the event back to the beautiful St. Andrew's Upper School campus this past Saturday afternoon. This year, the St. Andrew's teams did quite well on their home turf, with Novice and Advanced placing 2nd in the final round, barely edged out of first place.  The Advanced team was composed of Captain Bryce Deskins, Katherine Salinas, Walton Schmidt, and Jonathan Zornio.  The Novice team, led by Captain Robbie Li, was rounded out by Adam Alvarado, Will Nickerson, Will Greskovich, and Ben Sirizzotti.  Congratulations to all the students who played in the tournament for representing the school so well.<br />
<br />
Thanks also go to our army of student and parent volunteers who set up, ran, and cleaned up after the tournament.  Special thanks to Dawn Bowyer for supplying snacks for the visiting teachers from other schools.	</div>

	<h1>Upper School Students Celebrate Dies Lustricus</h1>
	<div class="story">
	In yesterday's Upper School Latin classes students celebrated the Dies Lustricus, or Purification Day. This day, 8 days after birth for girls and 9 days after birth for boys in ancient Rome, was the celebration at which Roman babies were given their names. Students are symbolically "purified" for the school year with a quick splash of water. Of course, no Roman celebration is complete without a sacrifice.  In this case gummy worms are used. Afterwards, students celebrated with a variety of snack foods, especially Lucky Charms cereal. Why Lucky Charms? The Dies Lustricus also was the day that children received their bullas, or lockets filled with lucky charms, in order to protect them from curses. Latin students can wear their good luck bullas on special days in order to earn a point or two of extra credit. All Upper School Latin classes are off to an auspicious start after a successful Dies Lustricus.  Photos of the event may be seen on our Twitter account @sasaustinlatin.	</div>

	<h1>St. Andrew's Middle and Upper School Latin Clubs attend 61st annual NJCL Convention at Emory University </h1>
	<div class="story">
	During the last week of July, twenty students from St. Andrew's Upper and Middle School divisions participated in the 2014 National Junior Classical League convention held at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. This trip to Atlanta for the St. Andrew's group also included a Braves baseball game, a float down the Chattahoochee River, visits to the Carlos Museum of Art on the Emory campus, the CNN Studio, the Georgia Aquarium, the Coca-Cola Museum, and the Georgia Tech campus, and a day of thrills at Six Flags Over Georgia.<br />
<br />
At the convention many students excelled in their individual academic, artistic, and athletic contests. The Advanced level competitive Certamen team, which included St. Andrew's students, won second place in the national tournament. Some students' work was recognized during a general assembly of convention delegates for achievement in special contests. Mariah Sager won 1st place in the State Digital Scrapbook contest for her excellent work as TSJCL Historian in the 2013-2014 school year. Wesley Wiedenmeier won 4th place in the State Website Contest for his redesign of the Texas State Junior Classical League website in his official capacity as TSJCL Webmaster in the 2013-2014 school year. Katherine Salinas, as Area F Chair for this coming school year, helped organize the Texas state spirit effort for Thursday's general assembly, and the Texas delegation won 1st place in spirit for that day! William McKinnerney also served in his official capacity at this convention as TSJCL Webmaster (and technology expert), helping to run Texas state fellowship meetings in the evenings with the rest of the TSJCL executive board. Additionally, Noelle Brimble was recognized as Best in Show in the English Oratory contest and was asked to perform her speech again during the Creative Arts awards assembly on the final day of convention. St. Andrew's alumnus Trace Turner '13, who attended the convention as a member of the Senior Classical League, edited and published the daily convention newsletter "The Convention Ear" in his official capacity as National Senior Classical League editor. Many convention attendees agreed that it was one of the best (and most entertaining!) series of "Ears" the convention had seen for a long while. At the end of convention, Trace was elected to the post of NSCL Vice President for the coming year.<br />
<br />
The Advanced Certamen team from Texas, which included three St. Andrew's students, a student from the Liberal Arts and Science Academy in AISD, and two students from Tom C. Clark High School in San Antonio, represented the entire state of Texas in the highest level of the competitive tournament.  The team was comprised of 2014 graduates Olivia Hindera and Nate Eakman, rising senior Bryce Deskins, as well as Cass Plowman of LASA, and Kevin Choy and Zihao Zhu of Clark High School. The team racked up the most cumulative points in the three preliminary rounds to earn the first-place seed for semifinals. After defeating the teams from Georgia and Illinois in the semifinal round, the team went on to play the final round against the team from Virginia and the team from Massachusetts, who were the defending national champions. Throughout the twenty-question round, the Texas and Massachusetts teams alternately held the lead until the last few questions when Massachusetts managed to pull ahead. The final score was Massachusetts-125, Texas-95, and Virginia-50.<br />
<br />
The team would like to thank the alternate players who have practiced with the team throughout the summer, Wesley Wiedenmeier and Walton Schmidt, and team manager Mariah Sager, as well as the numerous alumni who came to practices, and all of the supporters who followed the competition via the @SASLatin Twitter feed. The team would also like to thank graduate Philip Swanger '08 for his help during the convention.  The coaching staff - Jennie Luongo, Andrew Rist '05, and Lauren Dill - is also grateful to the supportive parents who provided food for long practices, both during the school year and into the summer, to achieve this fantastic result of second place in the nation.<br />

	<h1>Advanced Certamen Team wins State Championship; Upper School Latin Students Recognized at Texas State Junior Classical League Convention</h1>
	<div class="story">
	On April 11 and 12, St. Andrew's Upper School students competed in academic, artistic, and athletic contests at the Texas State Junior Classical League convention at Westwood High School.<br />
<br />
Two Austin-area Certamen teams which included students from St. Andrew's competed in the state tournament.  The advanced division team, composed almost entirely of St. Andrew's students Bryce Deskins, Nate Eakman, Wesley Wiedenmeier, and captain Olivia Hindera, won the State championship and defeated a team from St. John's in Houston and a combined San Antonio-area team in a close final round. They will represent Texas at the National convention this summer at Emory University.  The intermediate division team, including St. Andrew's students Rachel Nezzer, Katherine Salinas, and Walton Schmidt, placed second after a hard-fought final round.  Congratulations to these Certamen players!<br />
<br />
Every year at the TSJCL convention, the member schools elect a board of student officers to lead the organization for the following year.  This year two St. Andrew's students have served as officers, Mariah Sager as Historian and Wesley Wiedenmeier as Webmaster.  At the convention this year, Katherine Salinas was officially sworn in as the new Area F Chair.  Katherine will be hosting next year's Austin-area Latin convention at St. Andrew's.<br />
<br />
One student won an award for having the highest score for his individual contest in any level: Jaron Shrock in Advanced Prose Reading Comprehension.  <br />

<br />
The Latin teachers would like to thank Dawn Bowyer for chaperoning this trip and Janice Salinas for coordinating snacks for the group at the convention. Thanks also to all the parents who donated food and showed up to watch Certamen finals. Good luck to all as we prepare for Nationals this summer at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia.<br />

	<h1>Middle School Latin Students Earn Accolades at State Latin Convention</h1>
	<div class="story">
	On Friday, April 11th and Saturday, April 12th eight middle school Latin students attended the annual Texas State Junior Classical League Convention, held at Westwood High School in Round Rock ISD.  More than 2,000 students attended this year's convention from middle schools and high schools all over Texas. <br />
The weekend's competition kicked off on Friday with students taking the Pentathlon, a five-category academic test that all students at the convention take. The evening activities continued with contests in vocal performance, passage recitation, and costume displays, all focused on Latin or Greco-Roman themes.<br />
Competition continued on Saturday morning, when all students competed in written academic contests on various subjects such as mythology, Roman history, and Latin vocabulary.  In addition to their contests, many of the students enjoyed other activities offered at the convention. There were athletic contests of both the individual and team variety. There was a catapult-building contest. There were seminars and workshops from Classics professors as well as college students; our very own St. Andrew's alumnus Trace Turner (class of '13) offered a talk on Roman coins and currency.<br />
	At the awards ceremony on Saturday evening, names of students who placed the top five of their contests for each level were announced. Students who placed in the top ten also received certificates for their achievements. Certificates for Pentathlon performance were also distributed. Despite our small contingency, each of the SAS middle school Latin students placed in the top ten of at least one, if not more, of their contests. <br />
The middle school Latin club would like to thank the parents who have helped support our efforts this year, either by purchasing cookie dough during our annual fundraiser, or by providing snacks for the competitions. We look forward to an exciting trip to the National Junior Classical League Convention this summer at Emory University in Atlanta!<br />

	<h1>St. Andrew's Shines at Baylor Latin Day</h1>
	<div class="story">
	Last Friday, February 28, members from the St. Andrew’s Intermediate and Advanced certamen teams drove to Waco to attend Baylor Latin Day at Baylor University. Every year, Baylor puts together this celebration of Latin, featuring a certamen tournament, a noun parsing bee, and a verb parsing bee. In addition to showing off their Latin knowledge, students had the opportunity to see Baylor University and experience some aspects of college life, like the dorm cafeteria.  The students who participated in these events were Bryce Deskins, Olivia Hindera, Will Josowitz, William McKinnerney, Rachel Nezzer, Katherine Salinas, Walton Schmidt, and Ariana Weiss. All who participated in the parsing bees did very well. Walton Schmidt and Will Josowitz made finals in the noun parsing bee. William McKinnerney and Ariana Weiss made finals in the verb parsing bee, and Rachel Nezzer won the verb parsing bee. The combined Intermediate-Advanced certamen team played very well, taking first place in the tournament.  Students were awarded books for their first place victories.  Congratulations to all the participants!	</div>

	<h1>Advanced Certamen Wins Area Championship; St. Andrew's Places Second in Sweepstakes</h1>
	<div class="story">
	On Saturday, February 8 the St. Andrew's Upper School Latin Club attended Area F Latin Convention at Connally High School.  Our Novice certamen team comprised of Allie Eakman, Gavin Massengale, and Noah Moore advanced to finals and won third place.  The Intermediate certamen team comprised of Rachel Nezzer, Katherine Salinas, captain Walton Schmidt, Janson Shrock, and alternates William McKinnerney and Will Josowitz won second place by a mere 10 points  The Advanced team comprised of Bryce Deskins, Nate Eakman, captain Olivia Hindera, and Wesley Wiedenmeier played an amazing final round, won first place and will represent the area at the state tournament.<br />
<br />
As a school, St. Andrew's Upper School took second in the overall academic sweepstakes, calculated by assigning points for first, second, and third place finishes.  Two students were recognized for having the highest score at any level on their tests:  Olivia Hindera in Mottoes and Jaron Shrock in Advanced Grammar.  Additionally, Jonathan Zornio and Olivia Hindera got the highest score on the Pentathlon of all students in their level (Latin III and Latin V+, respectively), a great accomplishment as every student at the convention takes that contest.  Nate Eakman was awarded a scholarship for $538 ($1 for every convention attendee) in recognition of the fact that he received the high score on the Decathlon test out of all the seniors at the convention.  Nate will be donating his winnings to Worldbuilders, a charity that uses the collective power of readers and authors to make the world a better place.<br />
<br />
Finally, Katherine Salinas, class of 2017, was elected Area F Chairperson for the 2014-2015 school year.   It will be her responsibility to host the next convention at St. Andrew's Upper School in the winter of next year.  <br />

	<h1>St. Andrew's Continues Latin Banquet Traditions </h1>
	<div class="story">
	On Sunday, November 10th the thirty-first annual St. Andrew's Latin Banquet was held in Nazro Hall on the 31st Street campus.  All Latin students in grades 5-12 participated and dressed in tunicae, togae, and stolae, according to their level of Latin.  Middle Schoolers and upper-level Upper Schoolers accessorized their garb to portray characters from Greco-Roman mythology and figures from Roman history.  During the banquet students were judged for the costume contests and sampled a three-course tasting menu based on food the Romans would have eaten.  <br />
<br />
Students prepared for the event in their Latin classes by studying about ancient Roman clothing and food.  Each Latin class from fifth grade through Pre-AP Latin also prepared poster boards on topics about this year's theme, "The Underworld."  During the banquet these posters were displayed and used as visual aids for the Latin III students to give oral presentations about each topic. The AP Latin students set up their own version of the Greco-Roman Underworld in Crusader Hall for students to experience during the festivities.  The Advanced Topics in Latin class prepared "rivers" of the Underworld for students to cross as they entered Nazro Hall.  The "price" to enter the banquet this year was not a coin, as the ancients believed was necessary for entering the Underworld, but rather a food item for the Hands for Hope Food Drive.  <br />
<br />
As many students who have attended the Latin Banquet since their Lower School years will tell you, the Latin Banquet offers many opportunities for the older students to inspire the younger students as they continue with their Latin studies. The younger students listen to the older students present about more advanced and interesting topics in the Latin language, Roman history, and mythology. The Upper School students work hard on their presentations, targeting the younger students in particular, trying to spark the interest that has driven them to continue with their own Latin education.<br />
<br />
While many schools are cutting their Latin programs due to budgetary constraints, St. Andrew's has continued offering students the opportunity to study Latin, the ancient language of the Romans that has given us the seven modern Romance languages. "The study of Roman culture which typically accompanies Latin study informs the study of any Western literature, art, or culture as well... If Latin were dead, every Western culture and language would be also bereft of life," comments former Notre Dame admissions counselor and current Harvard assistant professor Matthew Potts.  In addition to offering students a unique insight into the origins of the modern Western world, the study of Latin boosts their English vocabularies, understanding of grammar, and logical thinking skills.  As Andrea Thomas, Assistant Director of Admission at Hamilton College states, "A background in Latin provides students with a stronger English vocabulary.  Open any SAT prep book, and you will see a crash course in Latin in the vocab section."<br />
<br />
Many thanks to the Latin Banquet Parent Chairs, Laura Buehler and Andy Deskins, along with all of the parents who volunteered to make this year's banquet such a great success!<br />

	<h1>Clark Certamen Tournament a Success</h1>
	<div class="story">
	The weekend of October 26th, the St. Andrews Certamen teams traveled to Clark High School in San Antonio for the annual Clark Certamen Tournament. All five teams from the middle and upper schools did extremely well.  The Advanced A-team consisting of captain Olivia Hindera, Ariana Weiss, Wesley Wiedenmeier and Bryce Deskins won all of their preliminary rounds and then advanced to the final round. In the first round they played Westlake Red and LASA, in the second round they played St. Andrew's B and Westlake Blue, and in the third round they played Reagan A and Churchill. After these three rounds, they made finals as the second highest scoring team. Clark Black and Reagan B also made finals. The St. Andrew's team was ahead most of the round, and going into the last tossup the score was St. Andrew's A with 115 points and Clark Black with 100. Clark got the last question and both boni, so they ended up winning by with 120 points to the St. Andrew's 115 points.  It was an exciting, close, and well-fought match-up.  The St. Andrew's teams will play next in San Antonio at St. Mary's Hall on December 7th.	</div>

	<h1>US Latin Club Celebrates the Anniversary of the Eruption of Mt. Vesuvius</h1>
	<div class="story">
	To memorialize the amazingly destructive and devastating eruption that occurred 1,934 years ago, the St. Andrews Upper School Latin Club had an eruption of a different kind- an exploding cake!  On August 26th, 2013 during X-Period the Latin Club celebrated the historical event of the Mt. Vesuvius's Eruption by a steaming, bubbling Mt. Vesuvius Cake courtesy of Mrs. Dawn Bowyer. The real eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in 79 A.D while vastly devastating the surrounding cities created a future archeological wonder for all of us to see in the modern day. The lava and ash preserved Roman cities literally in a stone tomb so air tight it prevented even food stuffs from degrading. Now these cities can be observed at the active archeological sites.  One of the best preserved cities, Pompeii, is now well known as a tourist attraction.	</div>

	<h1>Latin students attend 60th annual NJCL Convention in Las Vegas</h1>
	<div class="story">
	Twenty members of the St. Andrew's Latin Club participated in the 2013 National Junior Classical League convention that was held at the University of Nevada in Las Vegas, Nevada from July 22nd to the 27th.  Participants competed in athletics (such as swimming, track, and ultimate Frisbee), art contests, and daily academic exams.  Many of the students placed in the top ten of their respective competitions, including academic tests, graphic arts, speaking and writing contests, and "Olympika" (athletics). Students also assembled for state fellowship and general assemblies, where they competed to show their spirit for their state, and marched in the Spirit Procession wearing their best Roman costumes along with about 1200 other Latin students from across the nation. The St. Andrew's trip also included a couple of spectacular Las Vegas shows, an awe-inspiring trip to the Hoover Dam, and an educational river raft tour.<br />
<br />
The NJCL Convention is run in part by student officers elected by the delegates to the convention.  Trace Turner has served the organization admirably for the last year as Editor of the Torch: US, the NJCL quarterly.  At this convention many of our 2013 grads also joined the Senior Classical League, an organization (made up of former JCL members after they graduate high school) that helps put on some of the events at NJCL convention. Upon becoming a member of the SCL at this convention, Trace Turner was elected to the position of SCL Editor.  Additionally Wesley Wiedenmeier, the Texas State Junior Classical League webmaster, won second place in the national website contest for all his work on the tsjcl.org website this past year.<br />
<br />
Two of our students were acknowledged for overall points as well. When a student places in the top five in a contest at NJCL he or she receives "personal sweepstakes points."  At the end of the convention awards are given for the most sweepstakes points in each category. Noelle Brimble placed 9th and Walton Schmidt placed 10th in the Creative Arts Sweepstakes category.<br />

	<div class="story">
	In a glorious ode to the end of the 2012-2013 school year Latin Club Students and friends celebrated at Mr. Michaud’s lake house by enjoying the pool and the nearby lake complete with trapeze swing. The famous annual Lake Party almost made history in being the first Lake Party to almost be rained out .In addition to the fun, games and rain, the 2013-2014 Officer Elections took place at the poolside in a ceremony led by our departing Senior Consul Trace Turner. This year’s election ended smoothly with Mariah Sager taking the Senior Consul position and only one tie for the Historicius Peregrinus position. The position is to be filled by co-historians James Krajicek (who is in charge of writing all articles pertaining to the Latin Club) and Caroline Graves (who will enter all Community Service and Publicity Contests for the Latin Club). <br />

	<h1>Middle and Upper School Latin Students Excel at the State Latin Convention</h1>
	<div class="story">
	On March 30 and 31, St. Andrew's Upper School students competed at the Texas State Junior Classical League convention at Clark High School in San Antonio, Texas.  Students participated in academic, artistic, and athletic contests.<br />
<br />
Two Austin-area Certamen teams that included students from St. Andrew's competed in the state tournament.

The novice division team including St. Andrew's students: Rachel Nezzer and alternates Walton Schmidt and Marshall Wilson placed second as well.  Congratulations to these Certamen players!<br />
<br />
Every year at the TSJCL convention, the member schools elect a board of student officers to lead the organization for the following year.  This year four St. Andrew's students have served as officers, Reeves Smith as Editor of the organization's publication, "the Torch," Olivia Hindera as Treasurer, Wesley Wiedenmeier as Webmaster, and Walton Schmidt as Area F Chairperson.  At the convention this year, Mariah Sager ran for the office of Historian, which she easily won.  Mariah will serve as Historian of the Texas State Junior Classical League during the next year.<br />

	<h1>Upper School Students Win Ancient Coins</h1>
	<div class="story">
	This year students at St. Andrew's Upper School are participating in the Ancient Coins for Education project.  Students in some Latin classes will be examining and identifying genuine Roman coins sent to us by the project, led by Trace Turner '13, an ancient coin enthusiast.  As part of this project, Upper School students in Latin 3, 4, and 5 participated in a competition to identify images on Roman coins.  Our school winner was Olivia Hindera '14 and for her excellent performance she received a Roman coin minted under Theodosius the Great.  <br />
<br />
Additionally, the Advanced Topics in Latin students participated in an essay writing competition.  Cameron Osborn's (class of 2013) essay, which was the winning essay selected from our school, was entered in the national competition.  His essay placed third nationally.  Cameron received both an ancient coin and a book prize.  Congratulations to both these ancient Roman coin experts!	</div>

	<h1>St. Andrew's Hosts Successful Area Latin Convention</h1>
	<div class="story">
		On Friday, January 18 and Saturday, January 19 the St. Andrew's Latin Clubs hosted the Area F Latin Convention at St. Andrew's Lower and Middle School.  Many student and parent volunteers spent countless hours setting-up, running, and cleaning up after the Convention, and it was a great success.  Our very own eighth-grader Walton Schmidt presided over the convention as the Area F Chairperson, taking a lead role along with his sponsor Lauren Dill in making the convention run smoothly.  The Latin teachers and clubs would like to sincerely thank everyone who came out to help us put on a great convention this year.<br />
In Certamen all of our teams did well.  Our Our Middle School Certamen team, composed of Layne Alam, Katie Cowan, William McKinnerney, Rachel Nezzer, Katherine Salinas, Janson Shrock, and captain Walton Schmidt advanced to finals and won second by a nail.  Our Novice Certamen team composed of Mark Ashworth, Max Bartee, Tom Hogan, James Krajicek, and captain Marshall Wilson won first place by 50 points.  The Intermediate Certamen team including captain Bryce Deskins, Ariana Weiss, Wesley Wiedenmeier, Jonathan Zornio, and alternates Harrison Benson, Henry Gaudin, and Caroline Graves also took first place.  The Advanced team (Olivia Hindera, captain Robert Luke, Zack Osborne, and Reeves Smith with alternates Sara Kane, Mariah Sager, and Trace Turner) won third place in a hard fought round.  Members of all four Certamen teams will have the opportunity to represent Area F at the State Latin Convention in April.<br />
As a school, St. Andrew's Upper School took second in the overall academic sweepstakes, calculated by assigning points for first, second, and third place finishes.  Four students were recognized for having the highest score at any level on their tests:  Olivia Hindera in Mythology, Mariah Sager in Latin Derivatives, Jaron Shrock in Reading Comprehension Advanced Prose, and Reeves Smith in Mottoes.<br />

	<h1>Eruption of Mt. Vesuvius Celebrated</h1>
	<div class="story">
	On August 27, Latin students witnessed the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in cake form. Although it was a tragedy when the volcano erupted in August AD 79, the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius brought forth much to celebrate for Latin students. For, without this disaster 1,933 years ago, we would never have discovered so much about the daily life of the Romans. Therefore, to celebrate the anniversary of the eruption, St. Andrew's Latin students take apart and eat an erupting chocolate every year.  The Latin Club thanks Mrs. Osborn whose sugary volcanic edifice made it another day to remember.	</div>

	<h1>Upper and Middle School Students Compete and Win at NJCL Convention at Wake Forest</h1>
	<div class="story">
	St. Andrew's Latin Club Attends National Junior Classical League Convention<br />
<br />
Seventeen members of the St. Andrew's Latin Club participated in the 2012 National Junior Classical League convention that was held at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina from July 26th to the 31st.  Participants competed in athletics (such as swimming, soccer, and ultimate Frisbee), art contests, and daily academic exams.  Many of the students placed in the top ten of their respective competitions, including Academic Tests, Graphic Arts, Writing Competitions, and Ludi Sports. Students also assembled for state fellowship and general assemblies, where they competed to show their spirit for their state, and marched in the Spirit Procession wearing their best Roman costumes along with about 1500 other Latin students from across the nation. The trip also included river rafting and visits to the Biltmore Estate and several college campuses.<br />
<br />
The NJCL Convention is run in part by student officers elected by the delegates to the convention, and this year, rising St. Andrew's senior Trace Michael Turner, was elected to the position of National Editor.  Trace will be responsible for the creation and publication of the NJCL's renowned publication, the Torch U.S.  Trace has previously held the same position in the Texas State JCL.  Trace will have a large hand in shaping and carrying out the agenda of the National Junior Classical League.<br />
<br />
Results for the individual events are listed below, but there is one achievement that must be noted first.  When a student places in the top five in a contest at NJCL he or she receives "personal sweepstakes points."  At the end of the convention awards are given for the most sweepstakes points in each category.  Recent St. Andrew's graduate, Ali Campion, placed 8th in the Creative Arts Sweepstakes.<br />
<br />
Ali was also chosen as "best in class" for her Dramatic Interpretation and was therefore asked to perform it again at the awards ceremony and later for the NJCL National Committee who recorded it for their website.  You will soon be able to see it at njcl.org.<br />

	<h1>Latin Students Compete at TSJCL Convention; Olivia Hindera Elected Treasurer of Texas State JCL</h1>
	<div class="story">
	On March 30 and 31, St. Andrew's Upper School students competed at the Texas State Junior Classical League convention at Clark High School in San Antonio, Texas.  Students participated in academic, artistic, and athletic contests.<br />
<br />
Two Austin-area Certamen teams that included students from St. Andrew's competed in the state tournament.  The advanced division team, including St. Andrew's students: Emma Richardson, Rachel Deleery, Connor Butler, and Olivia Hindera, placed second by a very close margin. The novice division team including St. Andrew's students: Bryce Deskins and Dawson Henderson placed second after a hard-fought final round.  Congratulations to these Certamen players!<br />
<br />
Every year at the TSJCL convention, the member schools elect a board of student officers to lead the organization for the following year.  This year three St. Andrew's students have served as officers, Trace Turner as Editor of the organization's publication, the "Torch," Jade Ross as Treasurer, and Ali Campion as President.  At the convention this year, Olivia Hindera ran for the office of Treasurer, which she easily won.  Olivia will serve as Treasurer of the Texas State Junior Classical League during the next year, joining Middle Schooler Walton Schmidt, the Area F Chair, on the board.<br />
<br />
Two students won an award for having the highest score for their individual contests in any level: Ali Campion received the high score award for Sight Recitation and Rachel Deleery scored the highest in the Pentathlon, a test taken by every student at convention.<br />

	<h1>Dies Lustricus</h1>
	<div class="story">
	Picture this: you walk into a dark class room where the only light given off is from a single candle. You look to your left, the couch and mini fridge are still there, you look to your right and what do you see? A Latin teacher garbed in a white bed sheet with only their hands showing. You slowly take your seat and anticipate what is to happen.<br />
	This is what happens to a Latin student on Dies Lustricus, or the day of naming. Dies Lustricus is a very important day to the Romans, and to St. Andrew Latin students. It’s kind of like the students ignogeration into SAS Latin. Because the Romans would wait nine days after a baby was born to make sure it survive, SAS Latin waits around nine days to see who will “survive” Latin class. On this day the child would receive, from a priest dressed in a white robe, a bulla. A bulla is a necklace with a round pendant that protects a child from the evil eye. Oh, that would explain why the Latin teacher is wearing a white bed sheet! Imitating the priests!<br />
Next scene: you walk up to your Latin teacher and hand to them your bulla. After handing the scary-Latin-teacher-dressed-in-a-white-bed-sheet your bulla you tell the class, in Latin, your new name. Then, BAM! A tree branch is being shook above you and causing water to fall onto you! What’s that? The Latin teacher is saying funny stuff in Latin! Then you walk back to your seat, your ceremony is over, and you have been accepted as a St. Andrew’s Latin student. <br />
And this friends, is what happens on Dies Lustricus. You receive your Latin name, and have an entertaining—yet slightly frightening—ceremony. As tradition serves, this is what each Latin student must participate in every year to receive their Latin name. <br />

	<div class="story">
	The Upper School Latin students are bringing history to life in the classroom by celebrating the memorial of the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius, the ancient volcano which destroyed Pompeii and other towns around the bay of Naples.  The Upper School Latin Club historian writes:<br />
<br />
Every year on August 24 students gather in Ms. Luongo's room to remember the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius. It's an important day in Latin history, as this eruption preserved four towns, burying them in ash and lava.  The Latin Club celebrates this day by baking a cake of course!  Mrs. Osborn so kindly baked a chocolate cake in the shape of a volcano and left a hole in the center for lava to erupt from.  A little bit of vinegar was added and seconds later pink lava was flowing from the top! Each Latin student was given a slice of cake and allowed to enjoy the special day in the company of other Latin students, teachers and parents.	</div>

	<h1>Two St. Andrew's Students Finish Top in the Nation at National Latin Convention</h1>
	<div class="story">
	Fifteen students from St. Andrew's Upper School participated in the 2011 National Junior Classical League convention held at Eastern Kentucky University from July 25 to July 30.  Many students excelled in their individual academic, creative arts, and graphic arts contests.  The Advanced level Competitive Certamen team--comprised primarily of St. Andrew's students--also won third place in the national tournament.  Additionally, another St. Andrew's student, Olivia Hindera, took second place in the Intermediate level Open Certamen tournament along with teammates from other states.  During the week all conventioneers gathered for daily general assemblies where they competed to show their spirit. As the Texas State Junior Classical League president for 2011-2012, St. Andrew's student Ali Campion led evening state fellowship meetings where Texas delegates prepared for the spirit competitions in addition to voting for next year's NJCL student officer board.  Incoming TSJCL Editor, Trace Turner, also assisted Ali, along with the rest of the St. Andrew's delegation who worked hard to support her in role as President.  On the final day of the convention all participants marched in the Day in Old Rome Procession through campus while wearing their best Roman costumes.  This trip to Kentucky for the St. Andrew's group also included a Cincinnati Reds baseball game, a day of thrills at Kings Island Amusement Park, and a visit to the beautiful Newport Aquarium.<br />
<br />
Two remarkable students managed to finish not only in first place in their level of Latin, but achieved the high score overall at the convention:  Scott Dollen on the Mythology test and Rachel Deleery on the Classical Art test.  This high score recognition means the student answered the most questions correctly out of any student at the convention in these written contests.<br />
<br />
The Advanced Certamen team from St. Andrew's (plus one Westlake Chap this year), three--time defending state champions, represented the entire state of Texas in this level of the competitive tournament.  The team was comprised of 2011 graduates Scott Dollen and Reid Swanger, Emma Richardson of the class of 2012, as well as Westlake High School 2011 graduate Mark Stone.  The competition was steep this year, however, and after a valiant climb to the second--seed position in semifinals these students found themselves playing the two great certamen powerhouse states of Florida and Virginia in the final round.  Although all players made a great effort to outplay the competition by answering the challenging questions quickly and accurately, both the Florida and Virginia teams had pulled ahead as the final round neared its end.  Although Texas was too far behind to catch up and place anywhere but third, they never gave up, continuing to play and attempting to answer questions correctly. Before the final question, when the score was Florida 130, Virginia 110, and Texas 60, Virginia had a chance to catch up and tie with Florida if they could answer the last question before the other teams.  Texas captain Reid Swanger, however, took the question before Virginia could answer, locking in Florida as the champions.  Although the Virginia players were most disappointed by the result, the Florida team sent grateful glances to the Texas players as they correctly answered the two following bonus questions.  The final score was Florida 130, Virginia 110, and Texas 80.  Although this hardworking Texas team from St. Andrew's did not finish first, they made their fans proud of their final round--never giving up and playing the last round like champions until the bitter end.<br />
<br />
The team would like to thank all their supporters--parents, friends, and teachers--as well as the alternate players who tirelessly practiced with the team throughout the summer: Connor Butler, Rachel Deleery, Nate Eakman, Olivia Hindera, Trace Turner, and team manager Catherine Pace.  The team would also like to thank graduate Philip Swanger '08 for his help during the convention.  The coaching staff--Jennie Luongo, Nathan Michaud, Andrew Rist, and Lauren Dill--is also grateful to the supportive parents for putting up with long practice hours to achieve this fantastic third place result.<br />

	<h1>Westwood Certamen Tournament a success for St. Andrew's teams</h1>
	<div class="story">
	The St. Andrew's Latin Club is very proud to announce that once again our certamen teams have been doing their best representing the school. Over the weekend at Westwood High School our Advanced Team placed first, beating the other local teams once again. The Novice Team hit a home run and brought back another first place trophy for our Latin Club. The Intermediate Team narrowly missed first place and continues to make our school proud with their performance by placing second. Although the Middle School team did not make it into the final round for their level, they are working hard to make that goal a reality at the next tournament.  The Latin Club would like to thank all members and parents who have helped support our teams. 	</div>

	<h1>Certamen teams brave traffic to compete at Clark tournament in San Antonio</h1>
	<div class="story">
	On October 30, the day before Halloween.  Five teams from St. Andrew's Upper School and one from the Middle School competed at the Clark Certamen tournament against stiff competition.  All teams performed well.  With several teams just missing the final round.  The defending national champion advanced team, consisting of captain Reid Swanger, Scott Dollen, Rachel Deleery, and Emma Richardson, did make it to the final round and emerged victorious, more than doubling the score of their closest competitor in the final round and blanking SPC rival St. Mary's Hall, thought to be their toughest competitor.  The team attributes this victory to a bout of near psychicness from team captain, Reid Swanger, who repeatedly made jaw-dropping educated guesses.  Said St. Mary's Hall captain, Andrew Margrave (clap clap, clap clap clap) in reference to Swanger's amazing final round, "that's just crazy."<br />
<br />
Congratulations to all teams.  All of the teams are looking forward to the November 20th tournament at Crockett	</div>

	<h1>Latin Club Sells Cookie Dough, Community Rejoices</h1>
	<div class="story">
	With the announcement on October 5th that the Latin Club had begun to sell cookie dough again, an elated community has taken to the streets in search of Latin students willing to sell them some delicious cookie dough.  The Latin Club increased demand for the delicious goodies even more when they announced that they would be selling the dough of revered community member, Colleen Kell, who, besides her successful career as a fifth grade teacher, is also a licensed food preparer.  Mrs. Kell's cookie dough has long been reputed superior to the dough of other distributors.  The St. Andrew's Latin Club has expressed great joy at the quality of the product they are distributing and are looking forward to great success.  Community members can get their hands on some delicious dough by finding an Upper or Middle School Latin student and ordering from them, or by visiting the Latin Department's website, saslatin.org (see link above).  Do not miss out on this great opportunity; the sale ends on October 27th.	</div>

	<h1>St. Andrew's Latin Club Ventures to Fargo, Brings Home National Certamen Championship</h1>
	<div class="story">
	Eighteen members of the St. Andrew's Latin Club participated in the 2010 National Junior Classical League convention that was held at North Dakota State University in Fargo from July 26th to August 1st.  While all of the students excelled in their individual academic and art contests, the Advanced Certamen team won the National Certamen Championship.  In addition to their individual contests, students assembled for state fellowship meetings and general assemblies, where they competed to show their spirit.  On the final day, students marched in the Day in Old Rome Procession through campus while wearing their best Roman costumes along with approximately 1500 other Latin students from across the nation. This trip to the Midwest also included seeing the Mall of America in Minneapolis and a day of fun at Valleyfair Amusement park.<br />
<br />
The advanced certamen team from St. Andrew's, two-time defending state champions, represented the entire state of Texas in this very heated competition.  Scott Dollen, Matthew Miller, Mason Osborn, and Reid Swanger were the primary players with Colin Vanderburg, Rachel Deleery, Ale Fairchild from Reagan in San Antonio and Andrew Margrave from St. Mary's Hall in San Antonio, serving as alternates.  (It is the prerogative of a state championship team to invite other outstanding players from around the state to play if they so choose.)  The team played three preliminary rounds on Wednesday and Thursday, racking up as many points as possible to gain a favorable position in the semifinal bracket.  The team advanced as the third seed into the semifinal where they played teams from New Hampshire and the certamen powerhouse state of Virginia.  After a slow start against Virginia, the team pulled ahead by 70 at the end of the match for a place in finals.  The team then faced two other certamen powerhouses--Wisconsin and Florida.  Both our team and Florida struggled to score many points early in the round as Wisconsin pulled ahead.  Halfway through the match things began to turn around, and our boys gained confidence when Reid Swanger correctly answered a literature question on a great buzz.  Soon after, Mason Osborn correctly answered a question about a lengthy Latin passage.  Mason answered the "passage" question correctly in every round of National competition.  Quite an accomplishment!  Matthew Miller continued the rebound when he correctly guessed the end of a Latin translation on a very early buzz.  However, the score remained close.  With three questions left in the match, Scott Dollen answered a mythology question correctly and pulled his team into the lead.  The final question was heart-stopping as Wisconsin signaled first but was unable to answer correctly and gain enough points for the win.  As Florida was answering the final question, the Texas supporters began celebrating knowing that our team had already won with a final score of Texas-90, Wisconsin-80, Florida-70.<br />
<br />
At the final awards ceremony the team received the Maureen O'Donnell memorial traveling trophy to bring home and a $500 prize to use as they please.  Traditionally the winning team donates this monetary award to the charity of their choice.  Our team chose one close to the heart of the St. Andrew's community--The Gazelle Foundation--the benefits of which they described with pride in their acceptance speech to the entire assembly of convention attendees.  Additionally 2010 graduate Matthew Miller was named Certamen MVP for his particularly impressive performance in the final match.<br />
<br />
This is the second National Certamen Championship for St. Andrew's students in the school's history, the first having been just six years before in 2004.  Three of the members of that 2004 team who are now St. Andrew's Latin teachers--Lauren Dill, Nathan Michaud, and Andrew Rist--served as coaches along with Latin department head Jennie Luongo.  The team would also like to thank 2008 SAS grad Philip Swanger for his help during practices before and during convention as well as their peers who attended practices and supported during the tournament.  Of course the players are ultimately grateful to their wonderful and supporting parents who helped feed the team throughout the long hours leading up to their success this summer.<br />
<br />
Additionally, there were many outstanding individual performances.  Sarah Thompson, who served as Texas State JCL newsletter editor for the 2009-2010 school year, received first place in the national publication contest.  Ali Campion also placed 10th in overall creative arts sweepstakes.  Reid Swanger placed fifth in Decathlon, the most challenging test at the convention, and won $100 cash for that accomplishment.<br />

	<h1>Advanced Certamen Team from St. Andrew's Wins Year's First Certamen Tournament</h1>
	<div class="story">
	On Saturday, October 31st, the St. Andrew's Upper School and Middle Schools sent teams to compete at the Hill Country Middle School Certamen Meet, affectionately known as Cougartamen. The six teams competed early that Halloween morning with tough competition from opposing middle and high school teams of all levels.  St. Andrew's entered teams in all levels (Novice, Middle School, Intermediate and Advanced) and did very well in all of them. <br />
<br />
Our Novice team played very well, took 2nd place. This team included Andy Newell and Eliana Gill. The match was very tough, and our team narrowly missed first place, just five points shy of tieing. <br />
<br />
The intermediate team, consisting of Connor Butler, Robert Luke, Cameron Osborn, Reeves Smith, and Trace Turner also competed and won second place, losing only to Hill Country Christian.<br />
<br />
Two teams from the Upper School competed in the Advanced category: the Blue Team and the White Team, named in honor of our school colors. Ali Campion, Emma Richardson, Daniel Martens and Jade Ross represented the Blue team, and Scott Dollen, Reid Swanger, Rachel Deleery, and Mason Osborn represented the While Team. The White Team advanced to the finals, beating the other two finalists, Hill County Christian and Westlake, by a margine of over one hundred points.<br />
<br />
The two teams from the Middle School that competed included 7th graders Asa Buehler, Logan Giberson, and Sam Martens, and 8th graders Evan Benitez-Young, Patrick Dunham, Nick Fox, Julia Josowitz, and Lancer Sharp.  Both teams played very well against other the middle school teams, but narrowly missed earning enough points to make it into the final round.<br />

	<h1>St. Andrew's students compete at state Latin convention</h1>
	<div class="story">
	<b>St. Andrew's Upper School students advance to nationals in two divisions of certamen.</b><br />
<br />
On March 27 and 28, St. Andrew's upper school students competed at the Texas State Junior Classical League convention at SMU in Dallas. Students participated in academic, artistic, and athletic contests.<br />
<br />
Two Austin area "all-star" teams won the state Certamen tournament and will represent Texas at Nationals this summer. The advanced division team was composed entirely of St. Andrew's students: Scott Dollen, Matt Miller, Duke Njie, Mason Osborn, and captain Reid Swanger. The novice division team included three St. Andrew's students: Connor Butler, a starter, and alternates Jose Lopez and Patrick Davis. The team also included players from Hill Country Christian Academy: Steven Baker, Thomas Ebner, Shane Jasek, Christian Johnson, Laura Mahaney, and Jonathan Mitchell. This is the first time that two Austin-area teams have advanced to Nationals in the same year. Congratulations to these Certamen players!<br />
<br />
Three students won awards for having the highest score for their individual contests in any level: Scott Dollen in Mythology, Matthew Miller in Grammar, and Colin Vanderburg in Sight Recitation. In addition, Reid Swanger had the highest score of any level IV student on the Pentathlon, the one test everyone at the convention takes.<br />

<b>MS Latin Students Earn High Sweepstakes Awards at State Latin Convention</b><br />
<br />
On Friday, March 27, twenty-four St. Andrew's Middle School Latin students departed for Dallas to attend the annual Texas State Junior Classical League (TSJCL) convention on the campus of Southern Methodist University. Our students' amazing success earned St. Andrew's the honor of fourth place in the novice division sweepstakes competition among all Texas middle schools in attendance.<br />
After our group visited a wonderful Etruscan exhibit at the Meadows Museum on the SMU campus, the weekend's competition kicked off with the Pentathlon, a five-category academic test that all students at the convention take.<br />
<br />
Competition continued on Saturday morning, when students competed in academic contests in various subjects such as Roman history and Latin vocabulary as well as reciting and pronouncing Latin passages. Some students participated in various visual and performing arts contests, with categories including everything from photography and pottery to vocal performance. Many of our students also competed in the athletic contests known as "Olympika" (track events) and "Ludi" (basketball, soccer, and volleyball).<br />
In addition to all of this competition, students met new friends at just-for-fun events such as Friday night's dance and Roman-themed movie screenings. One of our students even entered the convention talent show and won first place playing his electric guitar. Congratulations to Max Schotz!<br />
<br />
After the competition on Friday and Saturday, the group took a little more time on Sunday to visit the King Tut exhibit at the Dallas Museum of Art as well as some exhilarating roller-coasters at Six Flags before returning home Sunday evening. Congratulations to all of the students who participated. We look forward to hearing about more successes from these wonderful students at this summer's National Latin Convention in Davis, California.<br />
