lyrics

   I know I'm not that tall
   I know I'm not that smart
   But let me drive my van into your heart
   Let me drive my van into your heart
   I know I'm not that rich
   I'm trying to get my start
   So let me drive my van into your heart
   Let me drive my van into your heart
   And if we look out of place
   Well, baby, that's okay
   I'll drive us into outer space
   Where we can't hear what people say
   I know I don't have a plan
   I'm working on that part
   At least I've got a van
   So let me drive my van into your heart
   Let me drive my van into your heart
   Let me drive my van into your heart
   Let me drive my van into your heart
   Let me drive my van into your heart
