About / CV

About

   I have been in the media industry since 2002 when I worked for [25]BBC
   South as a Camera Assistant for their [26]Music Live production. Since
   then, my desire to develop within this industry has never faltered. I
   have worked for other broadcasters such as Teachers TV and for
   Production companies such as [27]Thumbs up Productions ([28]Britain’s
   Next Top Model) which all came after my Fdg in Broadcast Post
   Production at [29]Ravensbourne. I now also work on a freelance basis
   for London TV companies, travel broadcasters, corporate and
   individuals.

   I pride myself on producing great content that leaves a wow factor with
   the client and the viewer. My ability to film and edit is also very
   handy and both have seen video broadcast domestically and around the
   world.

   I have also developed in other areas such as event photography and
   managing websites and these are all areas that will combine well with
   my video production background.

   It was a perfect video and looked very nice in ultra high definition.
   Thankyou.

James Hilling

WuWu & Retention Manager

   Steve, for me, is a real artist in his own right but also someone who
   just gets on with the job. Many past videographers and photographers
   i’ve worked with have been pre-madonnas, not Steve, he gets the job
   done simply and efficiently.

   testo-03

Keith Maynard

TV Presenter (Ideal World)

   Steve is extremely professional with a clear creative vision, and his
   enthusiasm did not falter even after 10 hours filming in Cologne for
   Planet Cruise. His dedication and technical skills resulted in some
   great VT inserts for the Amazing Cruise Show on Ideal World.

   testo-03

Julia Hunter

Rainbow Nursery

   We always have lots of positive comments from the parents about the
   Nativity Play DVDs that Steve produces for us each Christmas. It really
   does save having the majority of parents trying to capture the
   performance themselves.
