[28]#8/8: Right to have personal data securely stored

   [29]January 25, 2016/ [30]Carl Hunter Roach

History

   [] []

   Identity fraud occurs when someone steals personal information and uses
   it to transact in the victim's name without their permission. As
   digital solutions have rolled out, more and more copies of personal
   data are being stored. They are stored using many database technologies
   and updated and accessed using many programming systems.

   As businesses moved online legislatures passed laws defining how
   personal data should be processed, stored and managed.

   The technology, though is complicated and security has often been an
   after-thought during the implementation process. Worse, changes at any
   level of a system can leave users open to identify fraud so the effort
   to prevent such criminal activity is never-ending.

Frustrations

   Candidates fear their personal data will be leaked to criminals and
   used for identify fraud. Companies fear letting their users down and
   the damage their reputations can suffer.

The side effect

   Candidates will avoid companies they don't trust with their personal
   details and pull back from engaging with companies. Companies will lose
   focus fire fighting

The standards we all need

   Companies need to take data, systems and process security seriously,
   from the board down. They need to recognise that security isn't a box
   to be ticked and forgotten but a continuous process that needs
   regularly reviewing.

   The industry needs to develop robust and recognised  security
   certificates that are as recognisable to consumers as the UK
   [31]Kitemark and EU [32]CE marking are for safety.
