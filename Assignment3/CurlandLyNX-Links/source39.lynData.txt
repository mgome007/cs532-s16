   Scarlet Monahan (born 1983) with her perceptive ability to capture, the
   simple and the quirky through the lens of a camera. This beautiful and
   talented young artist, creates atmospheric surrealist figurative work,
   along with her well recognized gift for stunning black and white iconic
                                   images.

   Monahan, also known for using herself as the model in most of her
   figure studies, describes herself as "a council girl  with a  camera,"
   which may be true, but is far from the truth.

   Exhibiting regularly in the UK and throughout the world, this
   internationally acclaimed artist, has created much vivid work,
   including photographic prints, album covers, digital illustrative
   pieces for writers and many images for electronic media. Some of her
   three dimensional works in stone and steel, are owned by international
   companies such as, FUJI FILM, PENTAX, ARRIVA and others.

   Scarlet Monahan, an artist of the moment and the future, relishes
   challenges and new ideas of all kinds and is actively available for
   commission, in joyful and vigorous pursuit of her art.
