      [d_60_90.jpg]
      Author has written 5 stories for RWBY.

      Am I like a broken record and a happy one Kay? And the words that
      repeat on my record.. Are...WHITEROSE 4 LIFE!! WE SSHALL NEVAAH SINKK!!

      Since that's out of my system, let's start with small introductions!
      I'm Pure! The awfully fantastic wolf author! Excuse me, I sometimes
      like to sit in the corner and make a bunch of happy wolf noises/author
      noises, so if you hear something, that's me. Hi. Why am I sitting on
      your computer desk? I really don't know, I guess it's better than the
      floor. Welcome to my profile though!
        __________________________________________________________________

      Quote ramblings
        __________________________________________________________________

      “To run with the wolf was to run in the shadows, the dark ray of life,
   survival and instinct. A fierceness that was both proud and lonely, a
   tearing, a howling, a hunger and thirst. Blessed are they who hunger
   and thirst. A strength that would die fighting, kicking, screaming,
   that wouldn't stop until the last breath had been wrung from its body.
   The will to take one's place in the world. To say 'I am here.' To say
   'I am.” ~ from O.R. Melling

   Without continual growth and progress, such words as improvement,
   achievement, and success have no meaning~ from Benjamin Franklin

   Strive for continuous improvement, instead of perfection. ~ from Kim
   Collins

   I'd like to think something I said in one of my stories as an
   inspirational thing that was easy to pass, but here it is guys.

   "I might have started off as the monster, but I will end my journey, as
   the hero." And yes, I will say this statement is so true. We've all
   been the monster to our own stories at some point in life, but the
   question that will always stand is, will you allow your monster to
   consume you? Or will you become the hero to your story?

   It gives me a huge buzz when people say they've enjoyed my books,
   because this grew out of a hobby, and it's an absolute passion, and
   it's lovely when I get feedback.~ Alison Weir

   How thin and insecure is that little beach of white sand we call
   consciousness. I've always known that in my writing it is the dark
   troubled sea of which I know nothing, save its presence, that carried
   me. I've always felt that creating was a fearless and a timid, a
   despairing and hopeful, launching out into that unknown. ~Athol Fugard

   Submitting your work is like getting on stage and pulling your pants
   down, and asking for comments~ I forgot who said this. Ops?

   Reviews help authors grow is all I'll say since I don't want to give a
   long speech on this, I'm sure others have already done that.

   You don't start out writing good stuff. You start out writing crap and
   thinking it's good stuff, and then gradually you get better at it.
   That's why I say one of the most valuable traits is persistence.
   ~Octavia Butler
     __________________________________________________________________

   I'm one of those authors who gets extremely excited for the next
   chapter of their own stories.

   I'm also the type of author who is always rereading their own stories
   criticizing themselves on mistakes and things that could potentially be
   improved, although being a lazy little wolf as well as a workaholic
   does not blend or mend well together. It always ruffles the hell out of
   my furr when I see a mistake that is commonly occurring with me then to
   just randomly feel fatigue. Curse you tiny paws! They can only do so
   much!

   I am totally not married to my keyboard, no sir, not this little wolf,
   what on earth gave you that silly assumption? -Uses paw to lovingly
   caress my keyboard-

   I am a very, very, affable wolf! Meeting new people, making new
   friends, all who which I can relate to in this fandom is just something
   that is always so amazing. Although be warned if you actually do gather
   enough courage, even though it's not needed to talk with me, I'll most
   likely form a small friendship bond with you, now if you talk to me
   more than 3 times or something, then you'll basically be like a normal
   friend to me.

   I have officially started to take commission, so If you'd like to have
   me write you a commission Pm me and we can settle something out while
   I'll also give you my patreon so you can properly send the money of how
   much you want me to write for you.

   Prices for writing of what you submit to my patreon? Well for every
   1,000 words I write for you will be 5$. Now prices probably will change
   further in the future since I'm starting off small with this right now.
     __________________________________________________________________

   If anyone ever is wondering just why my grammar is off from time to
   time or even in the past time, then I'm going to honestly tell you
   that, before I started writing, grammar was something I never focused
   on for the fact that there are some schools out there are do no fully
   go over things with their students as good as they should have. Might I
   say I can name quite a few public schools that do need to improve in
   their systems, but anyways, grammar was something I knew little on, so
   here I am, having to self-teach myself grammar all over again. I want
   to thank those who have been giving me tips in grammar because I
   sometimes completely forget an entire subject in grammar, however, I
   also will say during the time I have been writing I have greatly
   improved.
     __________________________________________________________________

   I have issues with quite a few words, such as, however, although,
   since, and, yet, before, and I think that's all the words I tend to
   overlap in my stories. I would say if I use these words too much feel
   free to push me off a cliff so I can die in a really funny way down by
   making jokes about Ruby pushing people off gazebos, but that will
   happen too fast for my liking, so just for now, remember, Gazebos are
   love, Gazebos are life.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Warning! Yes, while I am a friendly wolf, I did not say I won't glomp
   attack you, so you know? You talk to me, prepare yourself for some
   really dorky wolf hugs as well as dorky conversations. I also say
   "Fight me" a lot to literally everyone. You tell me something is cute,
   I'm going to glomp fight you, and I'm not even joking on this topic.
   I'm 100% serious you adorable human person! I might be small, but you
   better start yelling timber when I burst into your Pms! Down with the
   tall people! I say that even though I'm pretty tall myself, I'm such a
   hypocrite, and just the irony here is pretty sad, but bro hands up!

   -Error mistakes that will forever be remembered-
     __________________________________________________________________

   Chapter 32- after Weiss had said that she pushed her lips back to the
   faunus's lips again and Ruby held Weiss's waist more tighter before
   slightly pushing Weiss off the rail of the gazebo for support since she
   felt her knees getting weaker" -Ruby has issues with pushing people off
   stuff xD

   Chapter 32- "Weiss, I tried to save the princess.." Weiss got up off
   her back and walked back over to ruby before helping her off the bench
   and watched her Ruby held her stomach whimpering "And all I got... Was
   that evil bitch to the stomach.."

   chapter 32- Weiss mumbled while leaning slightly against the rail and
   looking at the moon's reflection on the water's surface while it
   slightly nipples, as small fish swam around it.

   Chapter 40- And no I don't mean Blake's charm. I saw hers..But there
   was a fourth aura combined with yours..Hoe?” VELVET, NO. PLEASE. HAHAH.
   RUBY ISN'T A HOE! STOP THE MISTAKES.

   Chapter 36- "The sudden rise in Yang's voice caused Weiss and Ruby's
   head to snap over to them before" Yang spoke so loud, they snapped
   their heads. YANG'S GOT THOR'S VOICE. THE POWERS OF HEAD SNAPPING. RWBY
   PARANORMAL!

   Chapter 30- Oh hey Velvet... Since you're part of the pack now and
   we're connected orally.. Can I ask you a few things?" Ruby and Velvet
   has one weird friendship don't you agree?

   Chapter 44- #KittyGetsTitty2015! Now this was not a mistake; it was
   something we just came up with while editing and personally, I want
   this to forever live on.

   chapter 44- Blake gets U-hauled away. IT'S A THING.

   Every time I see these, I laugh. EVERY TIME.
