About me

Professional

     "...Today's programmers still work in a world where changing tabs to
     spaces leaves them, basically, fucked."
     -- Scott Rosenberg

   I'm currently looking for a software engineering job in a collaborative
   environment, working on problems that have a direct effect on users. My
   experience is largely with modern type-safe programming languages like
   Haskell, Rust, and Erlang, but I'm more interested in finding the right
   team to work with than in the specific choices of technology. Please
   visit my [9]LinkedIn profile and contact me via LinkedIn or via email (
   mylastname at alum dot wellesley dot edu ).

   Most recently, I worked as a Senior Member of Technical Staff at
   [10]Heroku, where I wrote Erlang for the HTTP Routing Infrastructure
   team. Before that, I was a Principal Software Engineer at
   [11]AlephCloud, where I wrote Haskell all day long. Until November
   2013, I was a research software engineer at [12]Mozilla, where I worked
   on implementing the [13]Rust programming language.

   I graduated from the [14]University of California, Berkeley with a
   master's degree in [15]computer science in 2004, and I graduated from
   [16]Wellesley College with a bachelor's degree in [17]computer science
   (minoring in mathematics) in 2001. From 2007-2011 I was working on a
   Ph.D in computer science at Portland State University, until I was
   [18]pushed out of the department for protesting sexual harassment.

   I live in Oakland, California.

Bio

     "Please don't leave us here alone in this silicon hell."
     --Allette Brooks

   In 2015 I asked my friends to write a bio for me ([19]thanks to Skud
   for this idea), and here's what they came up with.

   Tim Chevalier was born in Massachusetts in 1980. He has occupied many
   roles and fit them to varying degrees of awkwardness ranging from
   "none" to "a lot": for example, Girl Scout, teenage writer of letters
   to the editor, UAW Local 2865 member, tenure-track graduate student,
   baritone in a men's peace choir, Mountain Goats fan, professional
   scolder (including being a scolder of fortune, amongst others), and
   computer programmer. He is knowledgeable about functional programming,
   language design, and cloud technologies. He graduated from Wellesley
   College with a BA in Computer Science and Mathematics in 2001, and from
   UC Berkeley with an MS in Computer Science in 2003. Tim has worked at
   Heroku, AlephCloud Systems, Mozilla, Portland State University
   (Oregon), and American Journal Experts, to name a few.

   Tim became interested in computers at a young age. He was fascinated by
   the idea of a machine that he could control and program to do his will.
   It allowed him to do everything from solve math problems to play games
   to draw cool pictures. However, after many years of working with
   computers and other changes in his life, that need for a deterministic
   machine faded. He ran screaming from the tech world, and with good
   reasons. The computer now seems like something that is too easy to
   understand so Tim has decided that he will be a social worker, life
   coach and energy healer. However, he can't afford to quit tech yet so
   all of this is hypothetical.

   He is a Californian cat father.

Testimonials

     * tim owned me on numerous occasions and continues to do so. --pg
     * Tim once shamed me in public and I loved it. Tim could probably be
       cooler if he shared his green medicine [1] with me. Tim will have
       to check my IP because I may have vandalized this page oops.
     * Tim once crowdsourced his professional bio, and it came out alright
       [citation needed]
     * Tim is A Real Mensch and a total cutie
     * Tim wrote [20]an amazing blog post and currently stands as the only
       person who has both written for Model View Culture and served on
       the organizing team for the International Conference of Functional
       Programming's annual Programming Contest.
     * Tim has several times helpfully and painfully corrected errors of
       mine. Also, he owes me a beer.
     * Tim cannot confirm or deny that he does not recall events such as
       those which may or may not be mentioned here.
     * Tim has amazing cooking skills and can work with a variety of
       dietary restrictions. He also has a better understand of what an
       anus looks like than some of his friends do. In case this isn't
       clear, Tim is not an asshole.
     * Tim spends his spare time herding spider monkeys for fun and
       profit.
     * Tim reads so much, he's really well in formed on some topics. He
       writes analysis of these topics, that are insightful, well thought
       through, and full of citations to source material. I have learned
       so much from Tim.
     * Tim is perpetually in verbose mode.
     * "while working with Mozilla, Tim may have destroyed half of Japan.
       or maybe that was another zilla. PR's bad" -- PR Gnus of the World
       (no srsly if you ask the PRG guy he'll probably agree to say this)

   (*) wait this looks like an anus. I'm out.

Opinions

     "Normal is a weapon of mass destruction. It's just as deadly, and
     just like those weapons, it'll never be found."
     -- Thea Hillman

   I'm a transsexual man, and I have opinions about sex, gender, and
   cisnormativity. Occasionally I [21]write about them. [22]Here's what I
   wrote in 2007 to announce my coming-out. My views have evolved since
   then; I'd summarize them now by pointing out that [23]cissexual people
   get to self-report their gender without having to "prove" it by
   exhibiting their anatomy or genetic makeup, and averring that the same
   right ought to be extended to everyone.

   As a male programmer who has spent a lot of his life getting perceived
   as a female programmer, one of the accomplishments I'm most proud of is
   hosting/maintaining the [24]Male Programmer Privilege Checklist for
   five years (originally written by [25]Kake, extended by me and others).
   The current version of the [26]Male Programmer Privilege Checklist
   resides on the [27]Geek Feminism Wiki.

   For several years I was a regular contributor and moderator on
   [28]geekfeminism.org and the [29]Geek Feminism Wiki. I aspire to always
   speak and act with [30]intersectionality in mind, knowing that aspiring
   is not enough and I'll often fail.

Software

   I don't currently write open-source software. From 2011-2013 I put most
   of my time into the [43]Rust project.

   Software I've written and am willing to show in public lives on my
   [44]community.haskell.org home page. I've also contributed a little bit
   of code to [45]GHC and even less code to [46]darcs. All of this is very
   old.

My quotations file

     "She had a pretty gift for quotation, which is a serviceable
     substitute for wit." -- W. Somerset Maugham

     * [47]Quotations that speak to me, or spoke to me several years ago,
       anyway.

Things that I wrote

     "I'm willing to show good taste, if I can, in somebody else's living
     room, but our reading life is too short for a writer to be in any
     way polite. Since his words enter into another's brain in silence
     and intimacy, he should be as honest and explicit as we are with
     ourselves." -- John Updike

     * [60]"The Bald Squirrel" (April 2000) -- a short play about online
       discourse / homage to Ionesco.

Organizations I support

   These are my favorite organizations that I regularly support; mainly
   financially at the moment, though that could change. If you have income
   beyond your and your family's basic needs, maybe you should support
   them too.
     * [61]National Network of Abortion Funds - making sure no one's
       finances mean they're forced to give birth when they don't want to
     * [62]Scarleteen - providing reality-based sex education to youth
     * [63]Partners in Health - health care and social justice, on the
       principle that everybody should have access to the same kind of
       health care you would expect for yourself or for a friend or loved
       one
     * [64]Transgender, Gender-Variant, Intersex Justice Project (TGIJP) -
       focusing on the needs of low-income trans and gender-variant women
       of color in the criminal justice system

Everything else

   [65]Things people have borrowed from me (you don't care)

   [66]Things I want to read that don't have entries in [67]All Consuming.
   (You probably also don't care.)

In memory

   I wish to remember [68]Esther Andrews, who died in 2001. Esther was my
   first friend who I interacted with unmediated by text on paper or a
   screen. She took all the risks and reached out to me despite a
   non-trivial age gap, and that seemed to come naturally to her. She told
   me once that I was a good listener.

   I also wish to remember [69]Bonnie Tinker, who died in 2009. I never
   really knew Bonnie, but she was central to the Multnomah Meeting of
   Friends, which I attended irregularly at the time. I always thought I'd
   have a chance to get to know her, and then a truck driver killed her.

   I also wish to remember [70]Igal Koshevoy, who died in 2013. I knew
   Igal as the face behind the Portland Functional Programming Group,
   which was a minor but important part of what kept me feeling connected
   to a bigger community when I lived in Portland. He set an example of
   how to run groups that welcome and include everyone. Igal committed
   suicide, and I wish that he could have been as kind to himself as he
   seemed to be to everybody else.

   I also wish to remember [71]Andrew Pimlott, who died in 2013. In 2007,
   Andrew helped me get a job when I needed one, and we were colleagues
   for a brief period before he left to take a hiatus from software
   engineering to work in a restaurant. Though we only worked together for
   a brief period, he was there for me at a very hard time in my life to
   patiently explain Haskell code, cook with me, and play Frisbee. He had
   a rare combination of genius and kindness.

   I also wish to remember [72]Paul Hudak, who died in 2015. Paul
   co-founded the Haskell programming language committee, and as such, did
   work (and inspired others to do work) that later shaped my own career
   for many years. When I interacted with him at programming language
   conferences, he came across as a warm and compassionate person.

   I also wish to remember [73]Nóirín Plunkett, who died in 2015. Nóirín
   was a technologist, writer, and activist who helped define feminist
   advocacy in the open-source community. They brought light wherever they
   went.

   Most of all, I wish to remember [74]Debra Boyask, who died in 2013.
   Debra was a teacher, researcher, comics creator, and to me, a friend
   and lover. The time she and I spent together was brief, but important.
   I take my tea with milk because of her.
